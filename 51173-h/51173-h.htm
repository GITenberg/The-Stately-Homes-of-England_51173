<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap06">ENGLAND is rich&mdash;immeasurably richer than any other country
under the sun&mdash;in its “Homes;” and these homes, whether of
the sovereign or of the high nobility, of the country squire or the
merchant-prince, of the artisan or the labourer, whether, in fact, they
are palace or cottage, or of any intermediate grade, have a character
possessed by none other. England, whose</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Home! sweet home!”</p>

<p class="pn1">has become almost a national anthem&mdash;so closely is its sentiment
entwined around the hearts of the people of every class&mdash;is, indeed,
emphatically a Kingdom of Homes; and these, and their associations and
surroundings, and the love which is felt for them, are its main source
of true greatness. An Englishman feels, wherever he may be, that</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Home <i>is</i> home, however lowly;”</p>

<p class="pn1">and that, despite the attractions of other countries and the glare and
brilliancy of foreign courts and foreign phases of society, after all</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“There’s no place like home”</p>

<p class="pn1">in his own old fatherland.</p>

<p>Beautifully has the gifted poet, Mrs. Hemans, sung of English
“Homes,” and charmingly has she said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The Stately Homes of England,</p>
<p class="pp7">How beautiful they stand</p>
<p class="pp6">Amidst their tall ancestral trees</p>
<p class="pp7">O’er all the pleasant land!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">and thus given to us a title for our present work. Of these “Stately
Homes” of our “pleasant land” we have chosen some few for illustration,
not for their stateliness alone, but because the true nobility
of their owners allows their beauties, their splendour, their picturesque
surroundings, and their treasures of art to be seen and enjoyed by all.</p>

<p>Whether “stately” in their proportions or in their style of architecture,
in their internal decorations or their outward surroundings, in
the halo of historical associations which encircle them, or in the families
which have made their greatness, and whose high and noble characters
have given them an enduring interest, these “Homes” are indeed a
fitting and pleasant subject for pen and pencil. The task of their
illustration has been a peculiarly grateful one to us, and we have
accomplished it with loving hands, and with a sincere desire to make
our work acceptable to a large number of readers.</p>

<p>In the first instance, our notices of these “Stately Homes” appeared
in the pages of the <i>Art-Journal</i>, for which, indeed, they were specially
prepared, with the ultimate intention, now carried out, of issuing them
in a collected form. They have, however, now been rearranged, and
have received considerable, and in many instances very important,
additions. The present volume may be looked upon as the first of a
short series of volumes devoted to this pleasant and fascinating subject;
others of a similar character, embracing many equally beautiful, equally
interesting, and equally “stately” Homes will follow.</p>

<p class="dc16">WE commence this series with <span class="smcap">Alton Towers</span>, one of
the most interesting of the many Stately Homes
of England that dignify and glorify the Kingdom;
deriving interest not alone from architectural
grandeur and the picturesque and beautiful
scenery by which it is environed, but as a perpetual
reminder of a glorious past&mdash;its associations
being closely allied with the leading heroes
and worthies of our country.</p>

<p>The Laureate asks, apparently in a tone of
reproach&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp20q p1">“Why don’t these acred sirs</p>
<p class="pp16">Throw up their parks some dozen times a year,<br />
And let the people breathe?”</p>

<p class="p1">The poet cannot be aware that a very large
number of the “parks” of the nobility and gentry
of England are “thrown up” not a “dozen
times” but a hundred times in every year; and
that, frequently, thousands of “the people”
breathe therein&mdash;as free to all the enjoyments
they supply as the owners themselves. Generally, also, on fixed days, the
chief rooms, such as are highly decorated or contain pictures&mdash;the <span class="smcap">State
Apartments</span>&mdash;are open also; and all that wealth has procured, as far as
the eye is concerned, is as much the property of the humblest artisan as it is
of the lord of the soil.</p>

<p>And what a boon it is to the sons and daughters of toil&mdash;the hard-handed
men&mdash;with their wives and children&mdash;workers at the forge, the wheel, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>

shadows of “tall ancestral trees” planted centuries ago by men whose names
are histories.</p>

<p>Indeed a closed park, and a shut-up mansion, are, now, not the rule, but
the exception; the noble or wealthy seem eager to share their acquisitions
with the people; and continually, as at Alton Towers, picturesque and
comfortable “summer houses” have been erected for the ease, shelter, and
refreshment of all comers. Visitors of any rank or grade are permitted to
wander where they will, and it is gratifying to add, that very rarely has any
evil followed such license. At Alton Towers, a few shillings usually pays
the cost consequent upon an inroad of four thousand modern “iconoclasts:”
the grounds being frequently visited by so many in one day.</p>

<p>The good that hence arises is incalculable: it removes the barriers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
separate the rich from the poor, the peer from the peasant, the magnate
from the labourer; and contributes to propagate and confirm the true patriotism
that arises from holy love of country.</p>

<p>Alton, Alveton, Elveton, or Aulton, was held by the Crown at the time of
taking the Domesday survey, but, it would appear, afterwards reverted to its
original holders; Rohesia, the only child of the last of whom, brought Alton,
by marriage, to Bertram de Verdon, who had been previously married to
Maude, daughter of Robert de Ferrars, first Earl of Derby. Alveton thus
became the <i>caput baroniæ</i> of the Verdon family, its members being Wooton,
Stanton, Farley, Ramsor, Coton, Bradley, Spon, Denston, Stramshall, and
Whiston.</p>

<p>From the Verdons, through the Furnivals and Neviles, Alton passed to
the Earls of Shrewsbury, as will be seen from the following notice of the
Verdon family. Godfreye Compte le Verdon, surnamed de Caplif, had a
son, Bertram de Verdon, who held Farnham Royal, Bucks, by grand
sergeantry, circa 1080. He had three sons, one of whom, Norman de
Verdon, Lord of Weobly, co. Hereford, married Lasceline, daughter of
Geoffrey de Clinton, and by her had, with other issue, Bertram de Verdon,
who was a Crusader, and founded Croxden, or Crokesden, Abbey, near Alton,
in the twenty-third year of Henry II., anno 1176. He married twice: his
first wife being Maude, daughter of Robert de Ferrars, first Earl of Derby
(who died without issue in 1139), and his second being Rohesia, daughter and
heiress of a former possessor of Alton, through which marriage he became
possessed of that manor, castle, &amp;c. He was Sheriff of the counties of
Warwick and Leicester, and, dying at Joppa, was buried at Acre. By his
wife Rohesia (who died in 1215) he had issue&mdash;William; Thomas, who married
Eustachia, daughter of Gilbert Bassett; Bertram; Robert; Walter, who was
Constable of Bruges Castle; and Nicholas, through whom the line is continued
through John de Verdon, who, marrying Marjorie, one of the co-heiresses
of Walter de Lacie, Lord Palatine of the county of Meath, had issue by her&mdash;Sir
Nicholas de Verdon of Ewyas-Lacie Castle; John de Verdon, Lord
of Weobly; Humphrey; Thomas; Agnes; and Theobald, who was Constable
of Ireland, 3rd Edward I., and was in 1306 summoned as Baron Verdon.
He died at Alton in 1309, and was buried at Croxden Abbey. His son,
Theobald de Verdon, by his first wife, Elizabeth, widow of John de Burgh,
Earl of Ulster, and daughter and one of the co-heiresses of Gilbert de
Clare, Earl of Gloucester, by “Joane de Acres,” had a daughter, married to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Lord Ferrars of Groby; and, by his second wife, Maude, daughter of Edmund,
first Baron Mortimer of Wigmore, had issue, besides three sons who died
during his lifetime, three daughters, who became his co-heiresses.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Alton Towers, from the Terrace.</i></p>
</div>

<p>One of these, Margaret (who married three times), had Weobly Castle for her
portion; another, Elizabeth, married to Lord de Burghersh, had Ewyas-Lacie
Castle for her portion; and the other, Joan, had for her portion Alton, with
its castle and dependencies. This lady (Joan de Verdon) married, firstly,
William de Montague; and, secondly, Thomas, second Lord Furnival, who,
for marrying her without the king’s licence, was fined in the sum of £200.
She had by this marriage two sons, Thomas and William, who were successively
third and fourth Barons Furnival, lords of Hallamshire. This William,
Lord Furnival, married Thomasin, daughter and heiress of Nicholas, second
Baron Dagworth of Dagworth, and had by her a sole daughter and heiress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Joan de Furnival, who, marrying Thomas Neville of Hallamshire, brother to
the Earl of Westmoreland, conveyed to him the title and estates, he being
summoned in 1383 as fifth Baron Furnival. By her he had issue, two
daughters and co-heiresses, the eldest of whom, Maude, “Lady of Hallamshire,”
married, in 1408, John Talbot, afterwards first Earl of Shrewsbury
and sixth Baron Talbot of Goderich&mdash;“<i>Le Capitaine Anglais</i>.” This nobleman,
whose military career was one of the most brilliant recorded in English
history, was summoned as Baron Furnival of Sheffield in 1409; created
Earl of Shrewsbury, 1442; and Earl of Waterford, &amp;c., 1446. He was slain,
aged eighty, at Chatillon, in 1453, and was buried at Whitchurch. This
Earl of Shrewsbury, who so conspicuously figures in Shakespeare’s <i>Henry VI.</i>,
enjoyed, among his other titles, that of “Lord Verdon of Alton”&mdash;a title
which continued in the family, the Alton estates having now for nearly five
centuries uninterruptedly belonged to them.</p>

<p>The titles of this great Earl of Shrewsbury are thus set forth by Shakespeare,
when Sir William Lucy, seeking the Dauphin’s tent, to learn what prisoners
have been taken, and to “survey the bodies of the dead,” demands&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Where is the great Alcides of the field,<br />

<p class="p1">From this John, Earl of Shrewsbury,&mdash;“the scourge of France,” “so much
feared abroad that with his name the mothers still their babes,”&mdash;the manor
and estates of Alton and elsewhere passed to his son, John, second earl, who
married Elizabeth Butler, daughter of James, Earl of Ormond, and was succeeded
by his son, John, third earl, who married Catherine Stafford, daughter
of Humphrey, Duke of Buckingham; and was in like manner succeeded by
his son, George, fourth earl, K.G., &amp;c., who was only five years of age at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
father’s death. He was succeeded, as fifth earl, by his son, Francis; who,
dying in 1560, was succeeded by his son, George, as sixth earl.</p>

<p>This nobleman
married, first, Gertrude Manners, daughter of Thomas, Earl of Rutland;
and, second, Elizabeth (generally known as “Bess of Hardwick,” for an
account of whom, see the article on Hardwick Hall in the present volume),
daughter of John Hardwick, of Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire, and successively
widow, first, of Robert Barlow, of Barlow; second, of Sir William Cavendish,
of Chatsworth; and, third, of Sir William St. Loe. She was the builder of
Chatsworth and of Hardwick Hall. To him was confided the care of
Mary Queen of Scots. He was succeeded by his son Gilbert, as seventh
earl. This young nobleman was married before he was fifteen to Mary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
daughter of Sir William Cavendish of Chatsworth. He left no surviving
male issue, and was succeeded by his brother, Edward, as eighth earl,
who, having married Jane, daughter of Cuthbert, Lord Ogle, died, without
issue, being the last of this descent, in 1617. The title then passed to
a distant branch of the family, in the person of George Talbot, of Grafton;
who, being descended from Sir Gilbert Talbot, third son of the second
earl, succeeded as ninth earl. From him the title descended in regular
lineal succession to Charles, twelfth earl, who was created by George I.
<i>Duke</i> of Shrewsbury and <i>Marquis of Alton</i>, and a K.G. At his death, the
dukedom and marquisate expired, and from that time, until 1868, the
earldom has never passed directly from a father to a son. The thirteenth
earl was a Jesuit priest, and he was succeeded by his nephew as fourteenth
earl. Charles, fifteenth earl, dying without issue, in 1827, was succeeded by
his nephew, John (son of John Joseph Talbot, Esq.), who became sixteenth
earl. That nobleman died in 1852, and was succeeded as seventeenth earl,
by his cousin, Bertram Arthur Talbot (nephew of Charles, fifteenth earl), who
was the only son of Lieut.-Colonel Charles Thomas Talbot. This young
nobleman was but twenty years of age when he succeeded to the title and
estates, which he enjoyed only four years, dying unmarried at Lisbon, on
the 10th of August, 1856. Earl Bertram, who, like the last few earls his
predecessors, was a Roman Catholic, bequeathed the magnificent estates of
Alton Towers to the infant son of the Duke of Norfolk, Lord Edward Howard,
also a Roman Catholic; but Earl Talbot (who was opposed in his claim by the
Duke of Norfolk, acting for Lord Edward Howard; by the Princess Doria
Pamphili, of Rome, the only surviving child of Earl John; and by Major
Talbot, of Talbot, co. Wexford) claimed the peerage and estates as rightful
heir. After a long-protracted trial, Earl Talbot’s claim was admitted by the
House of Lords, in 1858; and after another trial his lordship took formal
possession of Alton Towers and the other estates of the family, and thus
became eighteenth Earl of Shrewsbury, in addition to his title of third Earl of
Talbot.</p>

<p>His lordship (the Hon. Henry John Chetwynd Talbot, son of Earl Talbot)
was born in 1803. He served in the Royal Navy, and became an admiral on
the reserved list. He was also a Knight of the Order of St. Anne of Russia,
and of St. Louis of France, a Knight of the Bath, and a Privy Councillor.
In 1830, his lordship, then Mr. Talbot, represented Thetford in Parliament;
and in the following year was elected for Armagh and for Dublin; and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
1837 until 1849, when he entered the Upper House as Earl Talbot, he
represented South Staffordshire. In 1852 his lordship was made a Lord in
Waiting to the Queen; in 1858 Captain of the Corps of Gentlemen at Arms;
and was also Hereditary Lord High Steward of Ireland.</p>

<p>He married in 1828 Lady Sarah Elizabeth Beresford, eldest daughter of the second Marquis
of Waterford, and by her had issue living four sons, viz.&mdash;Charles John,
present, nineteenth, Earl of Shrewsbury; the Hon. Walter Cecil Talbot, who,
in 1869, assumed, by Royal Sign Manual, the surname of Carpenter in lieu of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
that of Talbot, on his succeeding to the Yorkshire estates of the late Countess
of Tyrconnell; the Hon. Reginald Arthur James Talbot, M.P. for Stafford;
and the Hon. Alfred Talbot; and three daughters, viz.: Lady Constance
Harriet Mahunesa, married to the Marquis of Lothian; Lady Gertrude
Frances; and Lady Adelaide, married at her father’s death-bed, June 1st, 1868,
to the Earl Brownlow. The eighteenth Earl died in June, 1868, and
was succeeded by his son, Charles John, Viscount Ingestre, M.P., as nineteenth
earl.</p>

<p>The present peer, the noble owner of princely Alton, of Ingestre, and of
other mansions, Charles John Talbot, nineteenth Earl of Shrewsbury, fourth
Earl of Talbot, of Hemsoll, in the county of Glamorgan, Earl of Waterford,
Viscount Ingestre, of Ingestre, in the county of Stafford, and Baron Talbot, of
Hemsoll, in the county of Glamorgan, Hereditary Lord High Steward of
Ireland, and Premier Earl in the English and Irish peerages, was born in
1830, and was educated at Eton and at Merton College, Oxford. In 1859 he
became M.P. for North Staffordshire, and, in 1868, for the borough of Stamford.
In 1868 he succeeded his father in the titles and estates, and entered
the Upper House. He formerly held a commission in the 1st Life Guards. His
lordship married, in 1855, Anne Theresa, daughter of Commander Richard
Howe Cockerell, R.N., and has issue one son, Charles Henry John, Viscount
Ingestre, born in 1860; and three daughters, the Hon. Theresa Susey Helen
Talbot, born in 1856; the Hon. Gwendoline Theresa Talbot, born in 1858;
and the Hon. Muriel Frances Louisa Talbot, born in 1859.</p>

<p>The Earl of Shrewsbury is patron of thirteen livings, eight of which are in
Staffordshire, two in Worcestershire, and one each in Oxfordshire, Berkshire,
and Shropshire.</p>

<p>The arms of the earl are, <i>gules</i>, a lion rampant within a bordure engrailed,
<i>or</i>. Crest, on a chapeau, <i>gules</i>, turned up, <i>ermine</i>, a lion statant, with the
tail extended, <i>or</i>. Supporters, two talbots, <i>argent</i>.</p>

<p>We have thus given a history of this illustrious family from its founder to
the present day, and proceed to describe its principal seat in Staffordshire&mdash;the
beautiful and “stately home” of Alton Towers.</p>

<p>The castle of the De Verdons, which was dismantled by the army of the
Parliament, stood on the commanding and truly picturesque eminence now
occupied by the unfinished Roman Catholic Hospital of St. John and other
conventual buildings, &amp;c. A remarkably interesting view, showing the commanding
site of the castle, and the valley of Churnet, with Alton Church, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
is fortunately preserved in an original painting from which our first engraving
is made.</p>

<p>The site of Alton Towers was originally occupied by a plain house, the
dwelling of a steward of the estate. A hundred and forty years ago it was
known as “Alveton (or Alton) Lodge,” and was evidently a comfortable
homestead, with farm buildings adjoining.</p>

<p>When Charles, fifteenth Earl of Shrewsbury, succeeded to the titles and
estates of his family, in the beginning of the present century, he made a tour
of his estates, and on visiting Alton was so much pleased with the natural
beauties of the place, and its surrounding neighbourhood, that he determined
upon improving the house and laying out the grounds, so as to make it his
summer residence.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> With that view he added considerably to the steward’s
dwelling, and having, with the aid of architects and landscape gardeners,
converted that which was almost wilderness into a place of beauty, he called
it “Alton Abbey,”&mdash;a name to which it had no right or even pretension. To
his taste, the conservatories, the temples, the pagoda, the stone circle, the
cascades, the fountains, the terraces, and most of the attractive features of the
grounds, owe their origin, as do many of the rooms of the present mansion.
A pleasant memory of this excellent nobleman is preserved at the entrance to
the gardens, where, in a noble cenotaph, is a marble bust, with the literally
true inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“He made the desert smile.”</p>

<p class="p1">After his death, in 1827, his successor, Earl John, continued the works at
Alton, and, by the noble additions he made to the mansion, rendered it what it
now is&mdash;one of the most picturesque of English seats. In 1832 his lordship
consulted Pugin as to some of the alterations and additions, and this resulted
in his designing some new rooms, and decorating and altering the interior
of others. Mr. Fradgley and other architects had also previously been
employed, and to their skill a great part of the beauty of Alton Towers is
attributable. The parts executed by Pugin are the balustrade at the great
entrance, the parapet round the south side, the Doria apartments over Lady
Shrewsbury’s rooms, on the south-east side of the house, called sometimes the
“plate-glass drawing-room,” the apartments over the west end of the great
gallery, and the conservatory, &amp;c. The fittings and decorations of many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the other rooms and galleries, including the unfinished dining-hall and the
chapel, are also his. The entrance lodges near the Alton Station are likewise
from Pugin’s designs.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Conservatories and Alcove.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The principal, or state, entrance to the mansion is on the east side, but the
private foot entrance from the park is by the drawbridge, while that from the
gardens and grounds is by a path leading over the entrance gateway or tower.
To reach the state entrance the visitor on leaving the park, passes a noble
gateway in an embattled and machicolated tower, with side turrets and
embrasures, near to which he will notice the sculptured arms of De Verdon,
of Furnival, and of Raby, and on the inner side of the tower, those of Talbot,
with the date, 1843. Passing between embattled walls, the entrance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
right is a majestic tower, bearing sculptured over the doorway the armorial
bearings, crest, supporters, with mantling, &amp;c., of the Earl of Shrewsbury.
The steps leading to the doorway are flanked on either side by a life-size
“talbot,” bearing the shield and the family arms, while on the pedestals, &amp;c.,
are the monogram of Earl John, and the motto “Prest d’accomplir.” Passing
through the doors the visitor enters the <span class="smcap">Entrance Tower</span>, a square
apartment of extremely lofty proportions. “The doors being closed after him,
he will at once notice the most striking feature of this hall to be, that the
entrance-doors and the pair of similar folding-doors facing them&mdash;each of
which is some twenty feet high, and of polished oak&mdash;are painted on their
full size with the arms, supporters, &amp;c., of the Earl of Shrewsbury. This fine
effect, until the place was dismantled a few years since, was considerably
heightened by the assemblage of arms, and armour, and of stags’ antlers, &amp;c.,
with which the walls were decorated. In this apartment the old blind Welsh
harper, a retainer of the family, with his long dress, covered with medals and
silver badges, sat for years and played his native strains on the ancient
bardic instrument of his country.</p>

<p>“From this apartment one of the immense pairs of heraldic doors opens
into ‘<span class="smcap">The Armoury</span>,’ a fine Gothic apartment of about 120 feet in length, with
oak roof, the arches of which spring from carved corbels, while from the
central bosses hang a series of pendant lanterns. The ‘armoury’ is lit on its
north side by a series of stained-glass windows, the first of which bears, under
a canopy, &amp;c., the portrait and armorial bearings of William the Conqueror;
the next those of ‘Marescallus pater Gilberti Marescalli Regis Henrici Primi,
temp. Will<sup>m.</sup> Conq<sup>r</sup>.;’ the third, those of Donald, King of Scotland, 1093;
the fourth, those of Raby; the fifth, those of De Verdun, the founder of the
castle of Alton (‘Verdun fund: Cast: de Alveton, originalis familiæ de Verdun,
temp. Will. Conq<sup>r</sup>.’); and the sixth, of Lacy&mdash;‘Summa soror et heres Hugonis
de Lacy, fundatoris de Lanthony in Wallia; Mater Gilberti de Lacy, temp.
Will. Conq<sup>r</sup>.’ In this apartment, from which a doorway leads to the billiard
and other rooms, hang a number of funeral and other banners of the house of
Talbot, and at one end is the Earl’s banner as Lord High Seneschal or Lord
High Steward of Ireland&mdash;a blue banner bearing the golden harp of ‘Old
Ireland’ which was borne by the Earl of Shrewsbury at the funeral of King
William IV. In the palmy days of Alton this apartment was filled with one of
the most magnificent assemblages of arms and armour ever got together,
amongst which not the least noticeable feature was a life-size equestrian figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of ‘the great Talbot’ in full armour, and bearing on his head an antique
coronet, in his hand a fac-simile of the famous sword which he wielded so
powerfully while living, bearing the words&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">‘Ego sum Talboti pro vincere inimicos meos</p>

<p class="p1">and on his shoulders his magnificent ‘Garter’ mantle, embroidered with
heraldic insignia. The horse was fully armed and caparisoned, the trappings
bearing the arms and insignia of its noble owner. The figure was placed on a
raised oak platform, richly carved; and on this, at the horse’s feet, lay the
fine war helmet of the grand old Earl. At the farther or west end of the
armoury, a pair of open screen-work doors of large size, formed of spears and
halberds, and surmounted by a portcullis&mdash;the whole being designed by a
former Countess of Shrewsbury&mdash;opens into&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Picture-Gallery.</span>&mdash;This noble gallery, about 150 feet in length,
has a fine oak and glass ceiling, supported by a series of arches, which spring
from corbels formed of demi-talbots, holding in their paws shields with the
Talbot arms, while in each spandrel of the roof are also the same arms. The
room is lit with sumptuous chandeliers. In this gallery was formerly a series
of tables, containing articles of <i>vertu</i> and a large assemblage of interesting
objects, while the walls were literally covered with paintings of every school,
including the collection formed by Letitia Buonaparte, which was purchased in
Paris by Earl John. It is now entirely denuded of this treasure of art. From
the Picture-Gallery a pair of Gothic screen-work oak and glass folding-doors,
with side lights to correspond, opens into&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Octagon</span> (sometimes called the ‘Saloon,’ or ‘Sculpture-Gallery’),
an octagonal room designed to some extent from the splendid Chapter House
at Wells Cathedral. Like this it has a central pier, or clustered column, of
sixteen shafts, from the foliated capital of which the ribs of the vaulted roof
radiate. Other radiating ribs spring from shafts at the angles of the room;
and where the radiations meet and cross are sculptured bosses, while a series
of geometric cuspings fills in between the intersecting ribs at the points of the
arches. Around the base of the central column is an octagonal seat, and
stone benches are placed in some parts of the sides. It is lit with pendant
Gothic lanterns.</p>

<p>“The ‘Octagon’ opens on its east side into the ‘Picture-Gallery;’ on its
west into the ‘Talbot Gallery;’ and on its north into the ‘Conservatory.’
On its south is a fine large window of Perpendicular tracery filled with stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
glass, while on the other four sides are small windows, diapered in diagonal
lines, with the motto, ‘Prest d’Accomplir,’ alternating with monograms and
heraldic devices of the family. Over the Picture-Gallery doorway the following
curious verses&mdash;a kind of paraphrase of the family motto, ‘Prest d’Accomplir,’
which is everywhere inscribed&mdash;are painted in old English characters on an
illuminated scroll:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘The redie minde regardeth never toyle,<br />
But still is Prest t’accomplish heartes intent;<br />
Abrode, at home, in every coste or soyle.<br />
The dede is done, that inwardly is meante;<br />
Which makes me saye to every vertuous dede,<br />
I am still Prest t’accomplish what’s decreede.</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘But byd to goe I redie am to roune,<br />

Par tout labeur qui vous peut faire repose.</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘Prest to accomplish what you shall commande,<br />
Prest to accomplish what you shall desyre,<br />
Prest to accomplish your desires demande,<br />
Prest to accomplish heaven for happy hire;<br />
Thus do I ende, and at your will I reste,<br />
As you shall please, in every action Prest.’</p>

<p class="p1">“Above this, and other parts of the walls, are the emblazoned arms of
Talbot, Furnivall, De Verdun, Lacy, Raby, and the other alliances of the
family; while in the large stained-glass window on the south side are
splendid full-length figures of six archbishops and bishops of the Talbot
family, with their arms and those of the sees over which they presided.
Beneath this window are two beautiful models, full size, of ancient tombs of
the great Talbots of former days. One of these is the famous tomb, from
Whitchurch, of John, first Earl of Shrewsbury, who was killed in battle
July 7, 1453. It bears a full-length effigy of the Earl in his Garter robes and
armour, and bears on its sides and ends a number of emblazoned shields of the
Talbot alliances, and the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘<i>Orate pro anima prœnobilis domini, domini Johanis Talbot, Comitis Salopiæ, domini
Furnival, domini Verdun, domini Strange de Blackmere, et Mareschalli Franciæ; qui obiit, in
bello apud Burdeux</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">VII</span> <i>Julii</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">MCCCCLIII</span>.’</p>

<p class="p1">“It is related that when this noble warrior was slain, his herald passing
over the battle-field to seek the body, at length found it bleeding and lifeless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
when he kissed it, and broke out into these passionate and dutiful expressions:&mdash;‘Alas!

your officer of arms forty years or more. It is time I should surrender it to
you.’ And while the tears trickled plentifully down his cheek, he disrobed
himself of his coat of arms and flung it over his master’s body. This is the
knight of whom we read&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">“From the north side of the ‘Octagon’ a flight of stone steps leads up to
a glass doorway, which opens into a glass vestibule, forming a part of the
‘Conservatory,’ of which I shall speak a little later on. This conservatory leads
into the ‘Dining-room’ and the suite on the north side, and the view along it
from the Octagon is charming in the extreme, not the least striking and sweetly
appropriate matter being the motto painted above the flowers and around the
cornice of the vestibule:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘The speech of flowers exceeds all flowers of speech.’</p>

<p class="p1">“On the west side a similar flight of steps and doorway open into</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Talbot Gallery</span>, a magnificent apartment of about the same size
and proportions as the ‘Picture-Gallery.’ It has a fine Gothic ceiling of oak
and glass, supported, like that of the Picture-Gallery, on arches springing from
demi-talbots bearing shields. The walls, to about two-thirds of their height,
are covered with a rich arabesque paper of excellent design, while the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
part is painted throughout its entire surface in diagonal lines with the Talbot
motto  ‘Prest d’Accomplir,’ alternating with the initials T. (Talbot) and S.
(Shrewsbury). On this diapered groundwork are painted, at regular intervals,
shields of arms, fully blazoned, with tablets beneath them containing the
names of their illustrious bearers. The series of arms on the south side shows
the descent of the Earl of Shrewsbury from the time of the Conquest, while
those on the north side exhibit the armorial bearings of the alliances formed
by the females of the House of Talbot. As these series are of great importance,
and have only heretofore been given in Mr. Jewitt’s work upon Alton Towers,
from which the whole of the description of the interior here given is copied, I
have carefully noted them for the reader’s information. On the south side,
commencing at the end next the ‘Octagon,’ the arms are as follows, the arms
being all impaled:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">“On and over the doorway are the arms and quarterings of the Talbots, and
the sculptured stone chimney-pieces are of the most exquisite character, having
Talbots supporting enamelled banners of arms under Gothic canopies, and
shields on the cuspings. At the top also is a shield, supported by two angels.
The fire-place is open, and has fire-dogs; and the tiles are decorated alternately
with the letter S for Shrewsbury, and I T conjoined, for John Talbot.</p>

<p>“At the west end is a splendid stained-glass window, exhibiting the names,
armorial bearings, and dates of Earl John and nine of his ancestors, who have
been Knights of the Garter&mdash;the garter encircling each of the shields. The
names are Gilbert, Lord Talbot, 19 Henry VI.; John, Earl of Shrewsbury,
1460; George, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury; George Talbot; Francis, 5th Earl of
Shrewsbury; Sir Gilbert Talbot, 1495; George, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury;

<p>“In the palmy days of Alton Towers, this room, the Talbot Gallery,
contained a splendid collection of choice paintings, a fine assemblage of rare
china, some exquisite sculpture, and a large number of articles of <i>vertu</i> of
every imaginable class and character. From the north side a small door
opens into&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Oak Corridor</span>, a narrow passage leading in a straight line to the
North Library, and having doorways opening on its left into both of the state-rooms.
The first of these rooms, after passing the ‘waiting-room’ or ‘ante-room,’
is&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The State Boudoir</span>, an octagonal apartment with a magnificent carved,
painted, and gilt Gothic ceiling. This, in former days, when it contained
some fine old cabinets, a service of regal Sèvres china, and some exquisite
portraits, and was filled with sumptuous furniture, was one of the most
charming rooms imaginable. Next to this is&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The State Bed-room.</span>&mdash;The ceiling is panelled, being divided by deep
ribs into squares, having the ground painted a pale blue; rich tracery of oak
and gold stretches toward the centre of each compartment, and terminates
with a gold leaf; the hollow mouldings of the ribs are crimson, studded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
gold; below is a deep cornice of vine-leaves and fruit picked out green and
gold; and the walls are hung with paper of an azure ground, relieved with
crimson and gold.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Temple.</i></p>
</div>

<p>“The State Bed, which is about 18 feet in height and 9 feet in width, is a
sumptuous piece of massive Gothic furniture, all gilt in every part and
massively carved. Around the canopy hangs the most costly of bullion
fringe, and the hangings, as well as those of the windows and other furniture,
are of the richest possible golden Indian silk. This room formerly contained
a toilet service of gold, and the whole of the furniture and decorations were of
the grandest character. The chimney-piece is of white marble, exquisitely
carved, and bearing on the spandrels the Talbot arms&mdash;a lion rampant within
a bordure engrailed. The furniture is all gilt like the bed, with which also
the drapery is <i>en suite</i>. The windows, as do also those of the boudoir, look
out upon a perfect sea of magnificent rhododendrons. One door opens into
the Oak Corridor, and another into&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Dining-Room</span>, from which, by a doorway, the Oak Corridor is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
entered, and from which, by a light staircase, access to the upper suite of
sleeping apartments, including the ‘Arragon room’ (and to the lower rooms) is
gained. From this ante-room&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The West Library</span> is entered. This apartment, a fine, sombre, quiet-looking
room, has a panelled ceiling, at the intersections of the ribs of which
are carved heraldic bosses. In the centre is a large and massive dark oak
table, and around the sides of the room are ranged fine old carved and inlaid
cabinets and presses for books. Over these presses, and in different parts of
this room and of the ‘North Library,’ are a number of well-chosen mottoes,
than which for a library nothing could well be more appropriate. Thus, in
these mottoes, among others we read&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘Study wisdom and make thy heart joyful.’</p>
<p class="pp6qs">“‘The wise shall inherit glory, but shame shall be the portion of fools.’</p>
<p class="pp6qs">“‘They that be wise shall shine as the firmament.’</p>
<p class="pp6qs">“‘Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and is rich in prudence.’</p>
<p class="pp6qs">“‘The heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth and add grace to his lips.’</p>
<p class="pp6qs">“‘Take hold on instruction; leave it not; keep it because it is thy life.’</p>
<p class="pp6qs">“‘Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it.’</p>

<p class="p1">“From this fine apartment the <span class="smcap">North Library</span> is entered by two open
archways. This room is similar in its appointments to the West Library, and
with it forms one magnificent whole. At the north-west corner of this room
(in the tower) is a charming apartment, connected with the library by an open
archway, called&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Poet’s Bay</span> or ‘Poet’s Corner,’ which is one of the most charming
of all imaginable retreats. The bay window overlooks the park and the
distant country for miles away, while the side windows overlook parts of the
grounds and buildings. The ceiling is of the most elaborate character,
covered with minute tracery and exquisite pendents picked out in gold and
colours. At the west end of the library is a stained-glass window with full-length
figures of ‘Gilbert Talbot’ and the ‘Lady Joan,’ with their arms under
Gothic canopies. From this room a door on the south side opens into the
‘Oak Corridor,’ while two open arches at the east end connect it with&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Music-Room</span>, the ceiling of which is an elegant example of flamboyant
tracery, the ground being blue, and the raised tracery white and gold.
The chimney-piece of white marble is elaborately sculptured, and from it rises
a majestic pier-glass. On either side are portraits of Earl John and his
Countess, life-size, surmounted by their coronets. The furniture which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
remains is of remarkably fine character, carved and gilt, and the walls are
here and there filled in with mirrors, which add much to the effect. On the
south side is a large and deeply-recessed bay window, like the rest, of Gothic
design, with stained glass in its upper portion, representing King David playing
on the harp, St. Cecilia, and angels with various musical instruments. In
front of this window is a beautiful parterre of flowers, the Conservatory being
to the left, and the state-rooms to the right. From the ‘Music-Room,’ glass
doors, in a Gothic screen, open into a small library, with Gothic presses and
stained-glass window with Talbot arms, &amp;c. From this room another similar
door opens into&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Drawing-Room</span>, a remarkably fine and strikingly grand Gothic
apartment, with a ceiling of flamboyant tracery of very similar design to the
one already named. To the right, on entering, a central door of Gothic
screen-work and glass opens into the <span class="smcap">Conservatory</span>, which, as I have before
said, connects this room and those on the north side with the Octagon and
those on the south side. The <span class="smcap">Conservatory</span> is entirely of glass, both roof and
sides, and has a central transept. It is filled with the choicest plants, and in
every part, except the vestibule, the sweetly pretty and appropriate text,
‘Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they
spin, yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
like unto one of these,’ is painted around the cornice. In the vestibule, as I
have said, the motto is, ‘The speech of flowers exceeds all flowers of speech.’
Over the Conservatory door, in stained glass, are the arms of Talbot, Verdun,
&amp;c.; the crowned rose and thistle; and other devices. Opposite to the
Conservatory, on the north side, is the ‘Saloon.’ The furniture of the
‘Drawing-room,’ the chairs, couches, and seats, are all of the most costly
character, some of them draped with the arms, supporters, &amp;c., of the earl in
gold and crimson damask. On a table in this room are arranged the various
addresses, in cabinets, &amp;c., presented to the late Earl of Shrewsbury on his
accession to the earldom and estates after the trial in 1860, and a magnificent
ancient casket, the outer glass case of which bears the inscription&mdash;‘La casset
Talbot presente par Jean, premier Comte de Shreusburie, sur son mariage a
Marguerite Beauclerc.’ On the walls, besides other paintings, is a fine full-length
seated figure of Queen Adelaide. The ends of the room are Gothic
screen-work, with doors and mirrors. One of these, at the east end, leads
into another small library, and so on by a small gallery, denuded of its objects
of interest, to the <span class="smcap">Chapel Corridor</span> (elaborately groined and panelled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
oak), from which the private apartments are gained, and which also leads
direct to&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Chapel</span>, which, although ruthlessly shorn of its relics, its paintings,
its altar, its shrines, and all its more interesting objects, is still one of the
most gorgeous and beautiful of rooms. It is enough to say that it is one of
Pugin’s masterpieces, and that the stained glass is perhaps the finest that even
Willement, by whom it was executed, ever produced. It is impossible to
conceive anything finer than was the effect of this chapel when it was in
perfect order.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>“With the drawing-room, as I have said, an open archway connects
another magnificent apartment, the <span class="smcap">Saloon</span>, which has a fine oak-groined
ceiling, with elegantly carved, gilt, and painted bosses. In the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
west side is a fine stained-glass window, representing Edward, the Black
Prince, full length, in armour, and with his garter robes, painted by Muss;
and opposite to this a doorway opens into a corridor leading to the drawing
and other rooms. The view from the north end of the saloon, looking down
its full length, across the splendid drawing-room, down the long vista of the
conservatory, and into the octagon at the farthest end, is fine in the extreme,
and is indeed matchless.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Corridor</span>, of which I have just spoken, is one of the most dainty
and minutely beautiful ‘bits’ of the whole building. It is of oak, the sides
are panelled and gilt, and from small clustered pilasters rises the elaborate
oak groining of the ceiling, the groining being what can only be expressed as
‘skeleton groining,’ the ribs alone being of oak, partly painted and gilt, and
the space between them being filled in with a minute geometric pattern in
stained glass. From this corridor a door in the north side opens into the&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Small</span> or <span class="smcap">Family Dining-Room</span>, a fine sombre-looking apartment, about
25 feet square, and furnished with a magnificent central table, and every
accompaniment that wealth can desire. The ceiling is of oak, panelled, and
has a rich armorial cornice, with arms of Talbot, running around it. The
chimney-piece, of dark oak, is a splendid piece of ancient carving. From the
corridor another doorway leads to a staircase connecting other private apartments
above, while at its east end it opens into&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The Grand Dining-Hall</span>, near which are the kitchens. This hall,
which was being remodelled and altered by Pugin at the time of the Earl’s
death, remains to this day in an unfinished state, but shows how truly grand
in every way it would have been had it been completed. The roof is one of
the finest imaginable, and from its centre rises a majestic louvre, which at once
admits a subdued light and acts as a ventilator. It is of truly noble proportions,
and the fire-places and carved stone chimney-pieces are grand in the extreme&mdash;the
latter bearing the arms, crest, supporters, motto, chapeau, &amp;c., of the Earl
of Shrewsbury. The sides of the room were intended to be panelled, as was
also the minstrels’ gallery, with carved oak, and a part of this is already
placed. At the north end is a fine large window, the upper part of which is
filled with armorial bearings, but the lower part has never been completed, and
is filled in with plain quarries. The arms in this window are those of Talbot
Earl of Shrewsbury, Clifford, Beauchamp, De Valence, Comyn, Mountchesny,
Nevile, Middleham, Clifford, Bohun, Strange of Blackmere, Tailebot, Troutbeke,
Claveringe, Buckley, Pembroke, Borghese, Doria, Lovetoft, Mareschal, Strongbow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
King Donald, Raby, Lacy, De Verdun, Castile and Leon, D’Angoulême,
William the Conqueror, Bagot, Mexley, Aylmer, and others.</p>

<p>“From here a short corridor leads to a small vestibule, from which the
other private apartments extend. Of these the principal one is the <span class="smcap">Boudoir</span> of
the Countess of Shrewsbury&mdash;a charming apartment, replete with every luxury
and with every appliance which taste and art can dictate. The ‘Doria’ and
other apartments are reached from near this by a circular staircase. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the vestibule the private entrance to the Towers is gained, and from it is the
private way across the entrance gateway into the grounds; and also through
the small tower and across the drawbridge the park is reached. The
drawbridge crosses the moat, and the entrance is fully guarded, and has all
the appliances of an old baronial castle.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>And now let us speak briefly of the situation of Alton Towers, and of its
grounds of matchless charms. Situate almost in the centre of England&mdash;in
busy Staffordshire, but on the borders of picturesque Derbyshire&mdash;Alton Towers
is within easy reach of several populous cities and towns, the active and laborious
denizens of which frequently “breathe” in these always open gardens
and grounds the pure and fragrant air.</p>

<p>The roads to it are, moreover, full of interest and surpassing beauty;
approached from any side, the traveller passes through a country rich in the
picturesque. Those who reach it from thronged and toiling Manchester, from
active and energetic Derby, from the potteries of busy Staffordshire, are regaled
by Nature on their way, and are refreshed before they drink from the full cup
of loveliness with which the mansion and its grounds and gardens supply
them.</p>

<p>The route from Derby passes by way of Egginton; Tutbury, whose grand
old church and extensive ruins of the castle are seen to the left of the line;
Sudbury, where the seat of Lord Vernon (Sudbury Hall) will be noticed to the
right; Marchington, Scropton, and Uttoxeter. Here, at Uttoxeter Junction,
the passenger for Alton Towers will alight, and, entering another carriage, proceed
on his way, passing the town of Uttoxeter on his left, and Doveridge Hall,
the seat of Lord Waterpark, on his right, by way of Rocester (where the branch
line for Ashbourne and Dove-Dale joins in), to the Alton Station. Arrived
here, he will notice, a short distance to the left, high up on a wooded cliff, the
unfinished Roman Catholic Hospital of St. John, and on the right, close to the
station, the entrance lodge to the Towers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>From Manchester the visitor proceeds by way of Stockport and Macclesfield
to the North Rode Junction, and so on by Leek and Oakamoor, &amp;c.,
through the beautiful scenery of the Churnet valley, to Alton Station, as
before.</p>

<p>From the Staffordshire Potteries the visitor, after leaving Stoke-upon-Trent,
will pass through Longton, another of the pottery towns, Blythe Bridge, Cresswell,
and Leigh, to Uttoxeter, whence he will proceed in the same manner as
if travelling from Derby.</p>

<p>There are, besides others of less note, two principal entrances to the park
and grounds of Alton Towers. One of these, the “Quicksall” Lodge, is on
the Uttoxeter Road, about a quarter of a mile from Ellastone. By this the
“Earl’s Drive” is entered, and it is, for length and beauty, the most charming
of the roads to the house. The drive is about three miles in length from the
lodge to the house, and passes through some truly charming scenery along the
vale and on the heights of the Churnet valley&mdash;the river Churnet being visible
at intervals through the first part of its route. Within about half a mile of
the house, on the right, will be seen the conservatory, ornamented with
statues, busts, and vases, and on the left a lake of water. A little farther on is
the Gothic temple, close to the road-side. At this point Alton Towers and the
intervening gardens burst upon the eye in all their magnificence and beauty.
It is a peep into a terrestrial paradise. Proceeding onwards another quarter of
a mile through a plantation of pines, the noble mansion stands before us in
all the fulness of its splendour. The lake, the lawn, the arcade bridge, the
embattled terrace, the towers, and the surrounding foliage come broadly and
instantaneously upon the view&mdash;a splendid and imposing picture&mdash;a place to
be gazed on and wondered at. By this drive the Towers are reached by way
of the castellated stable-screen, and so on over the bridge and the entrance to
the gardens.</p>

<p>The other, and usual, lodge, is close by the Alton Station on the Churnet
Valley (North Staffordshire) Railway. This lodge, designed by Pugin, and
decorated with the sculptured arms of the family, is about a mile from the
house, and the carriage-drive up the wood is on the ascent all the way. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
path, called “the steps,” for foot passengers, turns off from the lodge, and
winds and “zig-zags” its way up, arriving at the house opposite to the Clock
Tower, and passing on its way some charming bits of rocky and wooded
scenery.</p>

<p>The gardens are entered from the park by a pair of gates (on either side of
which is a superb cedar) in an archway, under the “Earl’s Drive” Bridge.
Near this spot is the <span class="smcap">Choragic Temple</span>, designed from the Choragic monument
of Lysicrates, at Athens; it contains a bust of Earl Charles, the founder of the
gardens, with the appropriate inscription&mdash;“He made the desert smile.”
From here the visitor then proceeds along a winding path with an arcaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
wall on one side, and the valley, from which come up the music of the stream
and the bubbling of the miniature fountains, on the other. This passes
between myriads of standard roses on either side, and long continuous beds
of “ribbon gardening,” or what, from its splendid array of continuous lines
of colours, may very appropriately be termed “rainbow gardening,” and pathways
winding about in every direction, among roses, hollyhocks, and shrubs
and flowers of divers kinds, to a pleasant spot to the left, where is a terrace
garden approached by steps with pedestals bearing choice sculptures. In the
centre is a sundial; behind this, a fine group of sculpture, and behind this
again a fountain, surmounted by a lion. The wall is covered with luxuriant
ivy, and headed by innumerable vases of gay-coloured flowers, above which, a
little to the back, rises one of the many conservatories that are scattered over
this portion of the grounds.</p>

<p>Passing onwards, the visitor soon afterwards reaches the <span class="smcap">Grand Conservatories</span>&mdash;a
splendid pile of buildings on his left. These conservatories are
three hundred feet in length, and consist of a central house for palm-trees, and
other plants of a similar nature; two glass-roofed open corridors filled with
hardy plants, and decorated with gigantic vases filled with flowers; and, at
one end, a fine orangery, and at the other end a similar house filled with different
choice plants and trees. In front of the Grand Conservatory the grounds
are terraced to the bottom of the valley, and immediately opposite, on the
distant heights, is the “Harper’s Cottage.” At the end of the broad terrace-walk,
in front of the conservatory, is <span class="smcap">The Temple</span>&mdash;a semi-open temple, or
alcove, of circular form, fitted with seats and central table. From this charming
spot, which the visitor will find too tempting to pass by without a rest, a
magnificent view of the grounds is obtained. Immediately beneath are the
terraces, with their parterres, ponds, arcades, and fountains, receding gently
from the view till they are lost in the deep valley, beyond which rise the
wooded heights, terrace on terrace, on the other side, and terminated with tall
trees and the buildings of the tower. From the temple a broad pathway leads
on to the <span class="smcap">Gothic Temple</span>, and so to the modern <span class="smcap">Stonehenge</span>&mdash;an imitation
Druidical circle&mdash;and other interesting objects. Retracing his path, the visitor
will do well to descend by the steps to a lower terrace, where he will find an
open alcove beneath the temple. From here many paths diverge amid beds of
the choicest flowers laid out with the most exquisite taste, and of every variety
of form, and studded in all directions with vases and statuary.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Alton Towers, from the Lower Terrace.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Descending a flight of steps beneath a canopy of ivy, a rosery, arched behind an open
arcade of stone, is reached. This arcade is decorated with gigantic vases and
pedestals, and from here, arcade after arcade, terrace after terrace, and flight
of steps after flight of steps, lead down to the bottom of the valley, where the
“lower lake,” filled with water-lilies and other aquatic plants, is found. In
this lake stands the <span class="smcap">Pagoda</span>, or <span class="smcap">Chinese Temple</span>. Before reaching this, about
halfway down the hill-side, will be seen the “upper lake,” a charming sheet
of water, filled with water-lilies and other plants, and containing, among its
other beauties, a number of fish and water-fowl. Over this lake is a prettily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
designed foot-bridge forming a part of what is called “Jacob’s Ladder”&mdash;a
sloping pathway with innumerable turnings, and twinings, and flights of steps.
Arrived at the <span class="smcap">Pagoda Fountain</span>, the visitor will choose between returning by
the same route, or crossing or going round the lake, and pursuing his way up
the opposite side, by winding and zig-zag pathways and small plateau, to the
top of the heights.</p>

<p>The ornamental grounds are, as will have been gathered from this description,
a deep valley or ravine, which, made lovely in the highest and wildest
degree by nature, has been converted by man into a kind of earthly paradise.
The house stands at one end or edge of this ravine, and commands a full view
of the beauties with which it is studded. These garden grounds, although only
some fifty or sixty acres in extent, are, by their very character, and by their
innumerable winding pathways, and their diversified scenery, made to appear
of at least twice that extent. Both sides of the ravine or gorge, are formed
into a series of terraces, each of which is famed for some special charm of
natural or artificial scenery it contains or commands; while temples, grottoes,
fountains, rockeries, statues, vases, conservatories, refuges, alcoves, steps, and
a thousand-and-one other beauties, seem to spring up everywhere and add their
attractions to the general scene. Without wearying the visitor by taking him
along these devious paths&mdash;which he will follow at will&mdash;a word or two on
some of the main features of the gardens, besides those of which we have
already spoken, will suffice. Some of these are:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Harper’s Cottage</span>, in which the Welsh harper&mdash;a fine old remnant of
the bardic race of his country, and an esteemed retainer of the family&mdash;resided,
is near the summit of the heights opposite to the “Grand Conservatories.” It
is in the Swiss style, and commands one of the most gorgeous views of the
grounds and their surroundings. It was built from the designs of Mr.
Fradgley, who was employed during no less than twenty-two years on works
at Alton Towers.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Corkscrew Fountain</span>, standing in the midst of a pool filled with
aquatic plants, is a column of unequal thickness of five tiers, each of which is
fluted up its surface in a spiral direction, giving it a curious and pleasing effect.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Gothic Temple</span>, at the summit of the heights, on the opposite side
from the “Harper’s Cottage,” and closely adjoining the “Earl’s Drive,” is a
light and picturesque building of four stories in height, with a spiral staircase
leading to the top. From it a magnificent view of the grounds, the towers,
and the surrounding country, is obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Refuge</span> is a pretty little retreat&mdash;a recessed alcove with inner room in
fact&mdash;which the visitor, if weary with “sight-seeing,” or, for a time, satiated
with beauty, will find pleasant for a rest.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Gothic Temple.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pagoda Fountain</span> is built in form of a Chinese pagoda. It is placed in
the lower lake, and from its top rises a majestic jet of water which falls down
into the lake and adds much to the beauty of the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stonehenge.</span>&mdash;This is an imitation “Druidic Circle” formed of stones, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
about nine tons in weight each; it is highly picturesque, and forms a pleasing
feature. Near to it is the upper lake.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Flag Tower</span>, near the house, is a prospect-tower of six stories in
height. It is a massive square building with circular turrets at its angles.
The view from the top is one of the most beautiful and extensive which the
country can boast&mdash;embracing the house, gardens, grounds, and broad domains
of Alton Towers; the village of Alton with its church and parsonage; the
ruins of the old castle of the De Verduns; the new monastic buildings&mdash;the
Hospital of St. John, the Institution, the Nunnery, and the Chapel; the valley
of the Churnet; Toot Hill; and the distant country stretching out for miles
around.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ina’s Rock</span> is one of the many interesting spots in the grounds. It is
about three-quarters of a mile from the Towers, on what is called the “Rock
Walk.” It is said that after a great battle fought near the spot (on a place
still called the “battle-field”), between Ceolred and Ina, Kings of Mercia and
Wessex, the latter chieftain held a parliament at this rock; whence it takes
its names. We have thus guided the reader through the house and grounds
of Alton Towers.</p>

<p>The district around Alton Towers is rich in interesting places, and in beautiful
localities where the visitor may while away many an hour in enjoyment.
The monastic buildings, on the site of old Alton Castle, are charmingly
situated, and deserve a few words at our hands. These we quote from Mr.
Jewitt’s “Alton Towers:”&mdash;“The monastic buildings, which form such a
striking and picturesque object from the railway station, and indeed from
many points in the surrounding neighbourhood, were erected from the designs,
and under the immediate superintendence, of the late Mr. Pugin, and are, for
stern simplicity and picturesque arrangement, perhaps the most successful of
all his works. The buildings have never been&mdash;and probably never will be&mdash;completed,
and they remain a sad instance of the mutability of human plans.
Commenced at the suggestion, and carried out at the expense, of a Roman
Catholic nobleman; planned and erected by a Roman Catholic architect; and
intended as a permanent establishment for Roman Catholic priests, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
the buildings rose in great pride and beauty, and were continued with the
utmost spirit, until the death of Earl Bertram, when, after the trials I have
recounted, the estates passed into Protestant hands, the works were at once
discontinued, and the buildings have since been allowed, with the exception of
the chapel and the apartments devoted to the residence of a priest (and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
school), to become dilapidated. The castle grounds on which these buildings
are erected are situated near the church, the buildings forming three sides of a
quadrangle&mdash;one being the school and institution, and the others the cloisters,
priest’s house, chapel, and other buildings. From this the moat is crossed by
a wooden bridge to the ruins of the castle and the hospital of St. John. The
buildings are beautifully shown on the engraving on the next page.</p>

<p>“The erection of these Roman Catholic buildings gave rise to much annoyance,
and much ill-feeling was engendered in the neighbourhood; and a hoax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was played on Pugin, whose susceptibilities were strong and hasty. It was
as follows: One day&mdash;of all days ‘April fool day’&mdash;he received the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Alton&mdash;Hospital of St. John.</i></p>
</div>

<p>“‘Dear Sir&mdash;It is with deep sorrow that I venture to inform you of a circumstance
which has just come to my knowledge; and, though an entire
stranger, I take the liberty of addressing you, being aware of your zeal for
the <i>honour</i> and welfare of the Catholic Church. What, then, will be your
grief and indignation (if you have not already heard it) at being told that&mdash;fearing
the bazaar, in behalf of the Monastery of St. Bernard, may prove unsuccessful&mdash;it
has been thought that more people would be drawn to it were the
<i>monks to hold the stalls</i>! Was there ever such a scandal given to our most
holy religion? It may have been done ignorantly or innocently; but it is
enough to make a Catholic of feeling shudder! <i>I</i> am not in a situation to
have the slightest influence in putting an end to this most dreadful proceeding;
but knowing you to be well acquainted with the head of the English Catholics&mdash;the
good Earl of Shrewsbury&mdash;would you not write to him, and request him to
use his influence (which must be great) in stopping the <i>sacrilege</i>, for such it really
is? Think of your Holy Church thus <i>degraded</i> and made a by-word in the
mouths of Protestants! I know how you love and venerate her. Aid her
then now, and attempt to rescue her from this calamity! Pray excuse the
freedom with which I have written, and believe me, dear sir, <span class="smcap">A Sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Lover of my Church, but an Enemy to the Protestant Principle of
Bazaars</span>.’</p>

<p>“Pugin wrote immediately to the earl in an impassioned strain, but, in
reference to this trick, when the light had at length dawned upon him, in
writing to Lord Shrewsbury, he says&mdash;‘I have found out at last that the alarm
about the monks at the bazaar was all a hoax; and rumour mentions some
ladies, not far distant from the Towers, as the authors. I must own it was
capitally done, and put me into a perfect fever for some days. I only read
the letter late in the day, and sent a person all the way to the General Post
Office to save the post. I never gave the day of the month a moment’s consideration.
I shall be better prepared for the next 1st of April.’</p>

<p>“The school, which was intended also as a literary institution, a hall, and a
lecture-room for Alton, will be seen to the right on entering the grounds; the
house, to the left, now occupied as a convent, being intended for a residence
of the schoolmaster. In the original design the cloistered part of the establishment
was intended to be the convent (the chapel being a nuns’ chapel), and
the parish church of Alton was intended to be rebuilt in the same style as the
splendid church at Cheadle. The hospital was to be for decayed priests. The
chapel is a beautiful little building, highly decorated in character, and remarkably
pure and good in proportions. In it, to the north of the altar, are buried
Earl John and his Countess, and to the south Earl Bertram. The following
are the inscriptions on the brasses to their memory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“‘Hic jacet corpus Johannis quondam Comitis Salopiæ XVI. qui hunc Sacellum et hospitium
construere fecit <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> MDCCCXLIV. Orate pro anima misserimi peccatoris obiit
Neapoli die IX No MDCCCLII Ætatis suæ LXI.’</p>

<p>“‘In Memoriam Mariæ Teresiæ, Johannis Comitis Salopiæ Viduæ, Natæ Wexfordiæ

<p>“‘Orate pro anima Bertrami Artheri Talbot XVII Com: Salop: ob: die: 10º August
1856. Requiescat in pace.’</p></div>

<p class="p1">“In the cloisters is another beautiful brass, on which is the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“‘Good Christian people of your charity pray for the soul of Mistress Anne Talbot wife
of Will<sup>m</sup> Talbot Esquire of Castle Talbot Wexford who died on the V day of May

<p class="p1"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“On a slab on the floor:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">“‘Of your charity pray for the soul of Sister Mary Joseph Healy of the Order of
Mercy. Who died 4th August 1857 in the 31st year of her age, and the 5th of her
Religious Profession. R.I.P.’</p></div>

<p class="p1">“On a brass:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘Orato pro anima Domini Caroli quondam Comitis Salopiæ qui obiit VI die Aprilis
anno domini MDCCCXXVII Ætatis suæ LXIV.’”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Alton Church</span> is also worthy of a visit, not because of any special architectural
features which it contains, but because of its commanding situation
and its near proximity to the Castle. It is of Norman foundation. The village
itself (visitors to the locality will be glad to learn that it contains a very comfortable
inn, the “Wheatsheaf”) is large and very picturesque, and its
immediate neighbourhood abounds in delightful walks and in glorious “bits”
of scenery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Demon’s Dale</span>&mdash;a haunted place concerning which many strange stories
are current&mdash;is also about a mile from Alton, and is highly picturesque.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Croxden Abbey</span> (or Crokesden Abbey) is a grand old ruin, within an easy
walk of Alton. It was founded by Bertram de Verdun, owner of Alton Castle,
in 1176.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that the renown of Alton Towers arises principally
from the garden and grounds by which the mansion is environed. But
if to nature it is indebted for its hills and dells, its steep ascents and graceful
undulations, art has done much to augment its attractions. It may have been
a “desert” when Earl Charles strove, and successfully, to convert it into a
paradise; but the rough material was ready to his hand, and to taste, with
judicious expenditure, the task was not difficult to make it what it became,
and now is&mdash;one of the most exquisitely beautiful demesnes in the British
dominions.</p>

<p class="dc13">THE county of Kent is one of the pleasantest of
the English shires; rich in cultivated and
pictorial beauty, it has been aptly and justly
called “the garden of England.” Patrician
trees are found everywhere: for centuries the
hand of ruthless and reckless war has never
touched them; its chalky soil is redolent of
health; its pasture lands are proverbially fertile;
its gentle hills are nowhere barren; in many
parts it borders the sea; and to-day, as it did
ages ago,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp20q p1">“It doth advance</p>
<p class="pp16">A haughty brow against the coast of France;”</p>

<p class="p1">the men of Kent are, as they ever have been,
and by God’s blessing ever will be, the “vanguard
of liberty.” Moreover, it is rich, above
all other counties, in traditions and antiquities; some of its customs have
continued unchanged for centuries; its ecclesiastical pre-eminence is still
retained; while some of the noblest and most perfect of British baronial
mansions are to be found in the graciously endowed county that borders the
metropolis.</p>

<p>Among the most perfect of its stately mansions is that to which we
introduce the reader&mdash;Cobham Hall, the seat of the Earl of Darnley, Baron
Clifton.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Its proximity to the metropolis&mdash;from which, if we measure
distances by time, it is separated by little more than an hour&mdash;would alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
supply a sufficient motive for its selection into this series. It is situated
about four miles south-east of Gravesend, nearly midway between that town
and Rochester, but a mile or so out of the direct road. The narrow coach-paths
which lead to it are shaded by pleasant hedgerows, and run between
lines of hop-gardens&mdash;the comely vineyards of England.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Cobham Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The mansion stands in the midst of scenery of surpassing loveliness,
alternating hill and valley, rich in “patrician trees” and “plebeian underwood,”
dotted with pretty cottages, and interspersed with primitive villages:
while here and there are scattered “old houses” of red brick, with their
carved wooden gables and tall twisted chimneys; and glimpses are caught
occasionally of the all-glorious Thames. A visit to Cobham Hall, therefore,
furnishes a most refreshing and invigorating luxury to dwellers in the
metropolis; and the liberality of its noble owner adds to the rich banquet of
Nature as rare a treat as can be supplied by Art. The Hall, independent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the interest it derives from its quaint architecture, its fine, although not
unmixed, remains of the Tudor style, contains a gallery of pictures, by the
best masters of the most famous schools, large in number and of rare
value.</p>

<p>Before we commence our description of the Hall, the demesne, the
Church, the College, and the village of Cobham,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> it is necessary that we
supply some information concerning the several families under whose guardianship
they have flourished.</p>

<p>Cobham Hall has not descended from sire to son through many generations.
Its present lord is in no way, or at least but remotely, connected
with the ancient family who for centuries governed the “men of Kent,”
and who, at one period, possessed power second only to that of the sovereign.
That race of bold barons has been long extinct, the last of them dying in
miserable poverty; and if their proud blood is still to be found within their
once princely barony, it runs, probably, through the veins of some tiller of
the soil.</p>

<p>The Cobhams had been famous from the earliest recorded times. In Philipot’s
“Survey of Kent”&mdash;1659&mdash;it is said that “Cobham afforded a seat and a
surname to that noble and splendid family; and certainly,” adds the quaint
old writer, “this place was the cradle or seminary of persons who, in elder
ages, were invested in places of as signall and principal a trust or eminence,
as they could move in, in the narrow orbe of a particular county.” In the
reign of King John, Henry de Cobham gave 1,000 marks to the king for his
favour. He left three sons, viz., John, who was Sheriff of Kent, Justice of
Common Pleas, and Judge Itinerant; Reginald, also Sheriff of Kent,
Constable of Dover Castle, and Warden of the Cinque Ports; and William,
also Justice Itinerant. The eldest, John de Cobham, was succeeded by his
son John, who in turn became Sheriff of Kent, one of the Justices of King’s
Bench and Common Pleas, and Baron of the Exchequer. His son Henry de
Cobham was Governor of Guernsey and Jersey, Constable of Dover Castle,
and Warden of the Cinque Ports; so was also, again, <i>his</i> son Henry, who
likewise was Governor of Tunbridge Castle, and was summoned to Parliament
6 to 9 Edward III. He was succeeded by his son John de Cobham, Admiral
of the Fleet, Justice of <i>Oyer</i> and <i>Terminer</i>, and Ambassador to France, who
in “10 Richard II. was one of the thirteen appointed by the predominant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
lords to govern the realm, but was after impeached for treason, and had
judgment pronounced against him, but obtained pardon, being sent prisoner
to the island of Jersey.” Dying in the ninth year of Henry IV., he left his
granddaughter, Joan, his heiress. This lady married for her third husband
Sir John Oldcastle, who assumed the title of Lord Cobham. Reginald
de Cobham, half brother to John, was Justice of King’s Bench, an Admiral, an
Ambassador to the Pope, and commander of the van of the army at Crecy.
He was succeeded by his son, Reginald de Cobham, who likewise was succeeded
by <i>his</i> son Reginald; he left an only daughter as heir.</p>

<p>No less than four Kentish gentlemen of the name embarked with the
first Edward in his “victorious and triumphant expedition into Scotland,”
and were knighted for services rendered to that prince in his “successful and
auspicious siege of Caerlaverock.” With Reginald de Cobham, as has been
shown, the male line determined. Joan, his daughter, is said to have had
five husbands, by only one of whom, Sir Reginald Braybrooke, she left issue,
Joan, who being married to Sir Thomas Broke, of the county of Somerset,
Knight, “knitt Cobham, and a large income beside, to her husband’s
patrimony.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Their eldest son, Sir Edward Broke, was summoned to parliament, as
Baron Cobham, in the 23rd Henry VI. In 1559 Sir William Broke entertained
Queen Elizabeth at Cobham Hall, in the first year of her reign, “with
a noble welcome as she took her progress through the county of Kent.” His
son and successor, Henry, Lord Cobham, was Lord Warden of the Cinque
Ports; but “being too deeply concerned in the design of Sir Walter Raleigh,”
he was deprived of his estates, though not his life.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>His younger brother, George, was executed; but Cobham “lived many
years after in great misery and poverty,” dying in January, 1619; and
sharing the humble grave of some lowly peasant, apart from the magnificent
tombs which cover the remains of his great and gallant ancestors. He is
said, by Weldon, to have been reduced to such extreme necessity, that “he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
had starved, but for a trencher-scraper, some time his servant at court, who
relieved him with scraps.”</p>

<p>A sister of Lord Cobham’s was married to Secretary Sir Robert Cecil:
his estimable and greatly beloved lady died in January, 1596-7. She was
also a kinswoman of Sir Walter Raleigh, and in one of his letters to Cecil
he says:&mdash;“It is trew that you have lost a good and vertuous wife and my
sealf an honorable frinde and kinswoman. Butt ther was a tyme when shee
was unknowne to you, for whom you then lamented not. Shee is now no

shee hath past the weresome jurney of this darke worlde, and hath possession

yow, or by sorrowing to dry upp your own tymes that ought to establish
them.” This lady was sister to two of the unhappy conspirators of 1603
and kinswoman to the third, as well as being wife of the chief officer of state
by whom these conspiracies had to be brought to light. Well therefore was
it, for her, that her pure spirit had taken its flight before the time of
attainder of her brothers, Henry, Lord Cobham, and George Broke, and
their baseness by falsity and otherwise in leading the much-injured Raleigh
to the scaffold. “Whatever mysteries,” says Mr. Edwards, “may yet hang
over the plots and counterplots of 1603, it is certain that George Broke
proved in the issue to have been the <i>instrument</i> of the ruin alike of his
brother Cobham and of Raleigh. It is also certain that mere ‘credulity of
the practices of malice and envy’ could never have ripened, save in a very
congenial soil, into the consummate baseness displayed both in the examinations
and in some of the letters of George Broke after his arrest. In certain
particulars his baseness exceeded his brother Cobham’s, and that is saying
not a little as to its depth.” His estates, at the time of their confiscation,
are estimated to have been worth £7,000 per annum; and he possessed
£30,000 in goods and chattels. His nephew was restored in blood; but
not to the title or property. These were transferred&mdash;“the manor and seat
of Cobham Hall, and the rest of Lord Cobham’s lands”&mdash;by James I. to one
of his kinsmen, Ludovick Stuart, Duke of Lennox, whose male line became
extinct in 1672.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lady Katherine, sister of the last Duke of Richmond and Lennox,
married into the princely family of the O’Briens of Thomond; but the Duke
“dying greatly in debt” the estates were sold. Cobham Hall was purchased
by the second husband of the Lady Katherine, Sir Joseph Williamson, who
resided there for some time.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In 1701 he died, bequeathing two-thirds of
his property to his widow. This proportion descended, on her demise,
to Edward Lord Clifton and Cornbury, afterwards Lord Clarendon, who had
married the sole child of this Lady Katherine, by her first husband, Henry
Lord O’Brien;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and on Lord Clarendon’s death without issue, in 1713,
his sister, Lady Theodosia Hyde, inherited; she married John Bligh, of
the kingdom of Ireland, Esq.; created, in 1721, an Irish peer by the title
of Lord Clifton of Rathmore, and, in 1725, Earl of Darnley in that kingdom.</p>

<p>For some years the Cobham estate was in Chancery. After a tedious
suit it was purchased by Lord Darnley for the sum of £51,000, to the third
part of which a Mrs. Hornby became entitled, as relict of the gentleman
to whom Sir Joseph Williamson had devised one third part.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The Blighs are an ancient family, connected with Devonshire and other
parts of the West of England as well as with Ireland. One of them, a
merchant of Plymouth, an ancestor of the present peer, married Catherine
Fuller, sister to William Fuller, Bishop of Limerick and Lincoln (1667-1675).
In 1721 John Bligh of Rathmore, in the kingdom of Ireland,
Esquire, who had married the Lady Theodosia Hyde, sister to Edward,
Earl of Clarendon (whose wife Catherine, daughter of Katherine Lady
Thomond, who had successfully claimed the barony of Clifton of Leighton
Bromswold, in the peerage of the United Kingdom, as being descended from
the first Lord Clifton, inherited the said barony from her mother), from whom
he inherited the title and the estates, was created Baron Clifton of Rathmere,
in the kingdom of Ireland, in 1721.</p>

<p>In 1723 he was created Viscount
Darnley of Athboy, and in 1725 Earl of Darnley, both in the peerage of
Ireland. He also succeeded to the title of Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold,
in the peerage of the United Kingdom, by which title he and his
successors sit in the House of Lords. His lordship was succeeded, as
second Earl of Darnley, by his son, who was again, on his death, succeeded
by his son John, as third earl. This nobleman, who was born in 1719,
married in 1766 Mary, daughter and heiress of John Stoyt, of Street, co.
Westmeath, and by her, who died in 1803, had issue John, afterwards fourth
earl; Lady Mary, married to Sir Lawrence Palk, Bart.; the Hon. Edward
Bligh, a general in the army; Lady Theodosia, married to her cousin,
Thomas Cherbourgh Bligh; Lady Catherine, married to Hon. Charles
William Stewart, afterwards Marquis of Londonderry; and the Hon.
William, a colonel in the army. The Earl died in 1781, and was succeeded
by his son John, as fourth earl. He married, in 1791, Elizabeth, daughter
of the Right Hon. William Brownlow of Lurgan, and by her had issue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Edward, fifth earl; Lady Mary, married to Charles Brownlow, Esq.; Hon.
John Duncan Bligh, Secretary of Legation at St. Petersburgh; and the Lady
Elizabeth, married to the Rev. J. Brownlow. His lordship died in 1831, and
was succeeded by his son Edward, fifth earl, who (born in 1795), married in
1825 Emma Jane, third daughter of Sir Henry Brooke Parnell, Bart., M.P.,&mdash;who,
having held office as Secretary at War, Paymaster-General of the
Forces, and Treasurer of the Navy and Ordnance, was created Baron
Congleton in 1841,&mdash;and sister to the present Lord Congleton. By this
lady, who is still living, his lordship had issue, John Stuart Bligh, sixth and
present earl of Darnley; the Hon. and Rev. Edward Vesey Bligh; the
Hon. and Rev. Henry Bligh; the Lady Elizabeth Caroline, and the Lady
Emma Bess, both of whom are married and bear the name of Cust&mdash;the
first being the wife of Reginald Cust, Esq., and the latter the wife of the
Rev. Arthur Perceval Purey-Cust. His lordship died in 1835, and was
succeeded by his eldest son, John Stuart Bligh, as sixth earl.</p>

<p>The present peer, John Stuart Bligh, sixth Earl of Darnley, Viscount
Darnley of Athboy, Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold, and Baron Clifton
of Rathmore, was born in 1827, and was educated at Eton and Christ Church,
Oxford, being B.A. in 1848, and M.A. in 1851. He married in 1850 the
Lady Harriet Mary Pelham, eldest daughter of the third Earl of Chichester,
and has by her issue, living, the Hon. Edward Henry Stuart Bligh, Lord
Clifton, who was born in 1851; the Hon. Ivo Francis Walter Bligh, born
1859; the Hon. Arthur Frederick Pelham Bligh, born 1865; the Lady
Edith Louisa Mary, born 1853; the Lady Kathleen Susan Emma, born 1854;
the Lady Alice Isabella Harriet, born 1860; the Lady Mary Rose Florence,
born 1868; and the Lady Constance Violet Lucy, born in 1869. His
lordship is a Deputy Lieutenant of the county of Kent; Hereditary High
Steward of Gravesend with Milton; and Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant
of the West Kent Yeomanry Cavalry. He is patron of the living of Cobham.
He has, besides Cobham Hall, a seat in Ireland, Clifton Lodge, Athboy, co.
Meath, and a town residence.</p>

<p>The arms of the Earl of Darnley are:&mdash;<i>Azure</i>, a griffin segreant, <i>or</i>,
between three crescents, <i>argent</i>. Crest:&mdash;A griffin’s head, erased, <i>or</i>,
Supporters:&mdash;Two griffins, wings elevated, <i>or</i>, ducally collared and chained,

<p>Such is a brief history of the several noble families through whom the
mansion, demesne, and estates of Cobham have passed.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Lodge.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Hall is backed by a noble park, amply stocked with deer, and
containing trees of great variety and immense size, some of them measuring
above thirty feet in circumference. It comprises 1,800 acres, and encloses
an area of about seven miles. The old approach, long disused, was through
an avenue of lime trees, consisting of four rows, and extending more than
half a mile in length from the dependent village. The present entrance is
through a red-brick, turreted gateway, adjacent to which is the “<span class="smcap">Lodge</span>.”
On nearing the house, the eye encounters a cedar of magnificent growth,
and to the left are the gardens, into which there are two terrace-walks&mdash;one
from the great gate, and another, at a considerable elevation, from the suite
of apartments which constitute the first floor. The view we have given is
the more ancient portion of the venerable edifice&mdash;the north wing, with
which the south wing mainly corresponds. They are, however, connected
by a centre, built by Inigo Jones; and this centre, which consists of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
façade with Corinthian pilasters, is out of keeping with the quaint gables,
octagonal turrets, ornamental doorways, carved cornices, projecting mullioned
windows, and elaborated chimneys, which distinguish the earlier dwelling
of the Cobhams. The structure thus assumes the form of a half H, the
wings being terminated by octagonal towers; a sunken wall in front encloses
a quadrangular lawn, ornamented with vases and statues. The wings
exhibit the dates 1582 and 1594, and retain all the characteristics of the
later Tudor style; although, as we have intimated, it has been materially
corrupted by the several alterations to which, from time to time, the mansion
has been subjected. The ordinary entrance is through a vaulted passage,
“built in the form of a Gothic cloister by James Wyatt,” which contains
the arms of the Cobhams, with the date 1587. This passage leads to the
grand staircase, and the several apartments on the ground-floor. The first
to which strangers are conducted is the dining-hall, which contains an
elaborately carved black-and-white marble chimney-piece, having quaint
and curious figures and buildings, and a series of portraits of rare excellence.
The Music-room, one of the suite added to the ancient building, affords a
brilliant contrast to the sombre and solid character of the dining-room. It
contains but one picture&mdash;full-length portraits of the Lords John and
Bernard Stuart, sons of the Duke of Lennox&mdash;a <i>chef-d’œvre</i> of Vandyke.
The chimney-piece is formed of the purest white marble, sculptured in bas-relief
after Guido’s “Aurora,” by the elder Westmacott, with fauns life-size,
as supporters. The ceiling was designed by Inigo Jones; it is divided
into several square and circular compartments, with a deep oval in the centre,
“superbly gilt and enriched by appropriate ornaments, among which are
twelve pendant coronets.” The apartment is in length 50 feet, in breadth
36 feet, and height 32 feet! and although superbly ornamented and richly
gilt&mdash;the pillars of the Composite order, being of white marble, and the
lining of scagliola&mdash;the whole is in fine harmony with the grace and chasteness
of the design. There are two galleries, one of which contains an
organ. The vestibule is a small chamber, decorated with valuable vases of
verd-antique. The Library contains a series of portraits of eminent literary
men&mdash;Bolingbroke, Sidney, Shakespere, Swift, and others; none of them,
however, advance strong claims to originality. On the walls of the Great
Staircase are hung several large pictures, which may bear examination before
the gallery is entered.</p>

<p>The grand staircase conducts, first to the Portrait Gallery, and next to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the Picture Gallery. The walls of the former are hung with portraits, among
which are many of exceeding interest, including those of heroes, statesmen,
kings and queens, church reformers, and poets, mingled without regard to
date or order. At the end of this gallery are, branching to the right and
left, the private apartments of the family; and in a room opening out of
the west end of the Picture Gallery, Queen Elizabeth is reported to have
slept when she honoured the Lord Cobham with a visit during her progress
through Kent. In the centre of the ancient ceiling are still preserved her
arms, with the date, 1599. The Picture Gallery is the great “show-room”
of the house. It is a noble apartment, the walls of which are covered with
works of Art, of rare value and unsurpassed excellence, the productions of
nearly all the great masters of Italy&mdash;including admirable examples of Guido,
Titian, Salvator Rosa, Rubens, Raphael, Spagnoletto, P. Veronese, Giorgione,
N. Poussin, and Guercino.</p>

<p>Every part of the venerable edifice contains, indeed, some object of
interest. The rooms, and halls, and galleries are thronged with rare and
beautiful works of Art; a series of perfect vases from Herculaneum lie on the
tables of the Picture Gallery; several antique busts and statues line the hall;
a magnificent bath, of red Egyptian granite, is placed in the entrance passage;
and the furniture and interior decorations are all of corresponding excellence
and beauty.</p>

<p>Although necessarily limited in our description of Cobham Hall, we have
sufficiently shown the rare treat a visit to it will afford those who, “in
populous city pent,” desire to convert occasional holidays into contributions
to intellectual enjoyment. The Hall and its contents will amply repay
examination; and the noble park is full of natural treasures&mdash;thronged with
deer, singularly abundant in singing birds, and containing trees unsurpassed
in magnificent size and graceful proportions. A group of these trees, known
as “the Three Sisters” (why we cannot say), we have engraved. One of
the walks conducts to a hillock, from the summit of which there is a splendid
prospect of the adjacent country, commanding views of the Thames and
Medway, and taking in the venerable castle, cathedral, and town of Rochester,
the dockyards at Sheerness, and the whole course of the great English river
to its mouth at the Nore. The pedestrian, pursuing this route, will pass the
Mausoleum, an elegant structure, built conformably with the will of the third
Earl of Darnley, and designed for the sepulture of his family. It was never
consecrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>But Cobham has other objects of interest: the venerable Church, and no
less venerable “College.” The “<span class="smcap">Church</span>,” dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen,
stands upon elevated ground at the entrance of the village. It consists of
a nave, aisles, and chancel, with an embattled tower, entered by an antique
porch. The tower is obviously of a more recent date than the chancel; the
former is very ancient. As in many of the Kentish churches, the walls were
formerly painted in fresco, of which evidence may be easily obtained by those
who examine them narrowly; the steps of the altar are paved with encaustic
tiles, of about the period of Edward III., of various patterns, but most of them
containing the <i>fleur-de-lis</i>. The whole aspect of the place indeed supplies
indubitable proof of very remote antiquity. It has been recently restored,
but with sound judgment and skill, by the accomplished architect,
Sir Gilbert Scott, R.A.</p>

<p>The roof of huge oak rafters, the Gothic arches, the brasses, broken and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
entire, which cover the floor, the quaint monuments let into the walls, the
delicately-sculptured piscina, the sedilia of carved stone, the singular font,
the rude vestry-room with its massive oak chest, the Scripture passages
painted on the walls, all bespeak the antiquity of the building.</p>

<p>“Nearly in the centre is the still beautiful tomb of Sir Thomas Broke,
the Lady Joan, and their ten sons and four daughters. It is of white
marble, over which, upon a black slab, lie the effigies of the knight
and dame. On either side are those of five of their sons, kneeling, and
wearing tabards, with their swords girded on. The figures of the four
daughters are carved on the east and west ends of the superb monument.
It bears the date 1561, under the arms of the Brokes quartered with those
of the Cobhams.</p>

<p>“On the floor of the chancel are the famous ‘Cobham Brasses,’ the most
perfect and most numerous assemblage now existing in the kingdom. The
series consists of thirteen, recording the memory of the Cobhams and
Brokes, ‘lords and barons of this manor of Cobham, with many of their
kindred, who for many descents did flourish in honourable reputation.’ Of
the thirteen, eight are in honour of the knights, and five are memorials of the
dames. These brasses, one and all, deserve the most careful examination
and notice. The earliest is to the memory of <i>John de Cobham</i>, the first
Knight Banneret, and Constable of Rochester; he is dressed in a shirt of
mail: round his waist is a rich girdle, sustaining a long sword. Eight lines
of Norman French are inscribed round the verge of the slab. The others are
to <i>Maude, Lady Cobham</i> (1370), probably wife of Baron Cobham, who was
Warden of the Cinque Ports in the time of Edward III., who is represented
with a dog at her feet. Over her head are the words ‘Icy gist dame Maude
de Cobham.’ <i>Maude, Lady Cobham</i> (c. 1385) supposed to have been the
wife of Thomas de Cobham. She has a flounce of fur at the bottom of her
dress. There are the remains of a mutilated canopy over her, and a fragment
of inscription says, ‘Icy gist dame Maude de Cobehm qe....’
<i>Margaret, Lady Cobham</i> (1385), wife of John de Cobham, the founder of
Cobham College. This is a remarkably beautiful canopied brass; the finial
of the canopy bearing a figure of the Virgin and Child. Around the brass is
the inscription, ‘Isy gist dame Margarete de Cobeham, iadiis fille a noble
en le Comte de Deuenischire; feme le sire de Cobeham, foundour de ...
morust le secounde in dimoys D’agust lan de grace, <span class="smcap lowercase">MCCCLXXXV.</span>, lalme de qy

of John, Lord Beauchamp of Stoke-under-Hamden, and first wife of Sir John
de Cobham. The inscription, in Longobardic capitals, is:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘Dame Jone de Kobeham gist isi<br />

Kike pur le Alme Priera<br />

of the Trinity, in which the Deity is delineated with a triple crown, and
the Holy Spirit has a human face. The figure of the knight is gone, but that
of his lady remains; and beneath are groups of eight sons and ten daughters.
<i>Sir Reginald Braybroke</i>, the second husband of Joan, Lady Cobham. <i>Sir
Nicholas Hauberk</i>, her third husband. <i>Joan de Cobham</i>: she died, as appears
from the inscription, ‘on the day of St. Hilary the Bishop, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1433.’ At

escutcheons of the Cobham arms and alliances. <i>Sir Thomas Broke</i> and one
of his three wives. Below them are seven sons and five daughters. Sir
Thomas died 1529.”</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">College</span> of Cobham” is now only a collection of almshouses, to
which presentations are made&mdash;of old people, without restriction to either
sex&mdash;as vacancies occur, by the parish and ten other parishes adjacent. It
lies immediately south of the church, and is entered by a small Gothic
gateway. Its occupants are twenty aged men and women, who have each
a little dwelling, with a neat garden and an allowance monthly, sufficient to
secure the necessaries of life. It is a quadrangular building, of stone,
measuring about 60 feet by 50; and contains a large hall, with painted
windows, a roof of blackened rafters, an old oak screen, and a fire-place of
cut stone. The history of the college is curious and interesting. A college
or chantry was originally founded here, about the year 1362, by John de
Cobham, thence called “the founder,” in the reign of Edward III. In the
Church is a brass to the memory of William Tanner, Master of the College,
who died in 1418. The brass consists of a half-length of the master, in
clerical costume, with the inscription in black letter:&mdash;“Hic jacet Willmus
Tannere qui prim obiit magister istuis Collegii xxii. die mensis Junii Anno
Dni. <span class="smcap lowercase">M°CCCC°XVIII</span>. cujus anime propicietur deus Amen.” Towards the end of
the reign of Elizabeth it was rebuilt, as appears by a record&mdash;“finished in
September 1598”&mdash;inscribed over the south portal, under the arms and
alliances of the Brokes, Lords Cobham. The endowments of the old foundation
were ample, and were, with the college itself, bestowed by Henry VIII.,
at the dissolution, upon George, Lord Cobham, who had the “king’s roiall
assent and licence by hys grace’s word, with any manner of letters patent or
other writings, to purchase and receyve to his heires for ever, of the late
master and brethren, of the college or chauntry of Cobham, in the countie
of Kent, now being utterly dissolved, the scite of the same colledge or
chauntry, and al and singular their heridaments and possessions, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
temporall as ecclesiasticall, wheresoever they lay, or were, within the realm
of England.” The walls of the ancient college may be clearly traced, and a
small portion still endures, comparatively uninjured. It is a gateway,
surmounted by the arms of the Cobhams, luxuriantly overgrown with ivy,
forming a fine example of picturesque antiquity. The present structure was
erected pursuant to the will of Sir William Broke, Lord Cobham, who
devised “all those edifices, ruined buildings, soil and ground, with the
appurtenances which some time belonged to the late suppressed college for
the use of the ‘new’ college.” By an act of the 39th of Elizabeth, the
wardens of Rochester Bridge for the time being were made a body corporate,
and declared perpetual presidents of the new college, the government of which
they retain to this day.</p>

<p>The dependent village of Cobham is one of the neatest and most pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the fair villages of Kent. There are, no doubt, many nobler and more
perfect examples of the domestic architecture of “old” England than is
supplied by Cobham Hall, but it would be difficult to direct attention to any
that affords so rich a recompense at so small a cost; taking into account its
genuine remains of antiquity, the magnificent works of Art that decorate its
walls, its easy access from the metropolis, and the primitive character and surpassing
beauty of the locality in which it is situated.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Western</span> conveys us from Paddington to Exeter. We leave
Exeter by the South Devon Railway (proverbially well managed, in all
respects): it may take us to Penzance; but its great station is midway, at
Plymouth, where has been recently erected for the especial accommodation of
railway travellers and tourists, an admirable hotel (the Duke of Cornwall&mdash;there
is none more comfortable in the kingdom).<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Here we arrest the tourist,
in order to visit the promontory of Mount Edgcumbe, that occupies one side of
the famous harbour.</p>

<p>First, however, let us glance at the several points of interest that claim our
attention <i>en route</i>. Leaving Exeter and its many attractions other than its
renowned Cathedral, we first reach the marine village of Starcross, opposite to
which are old Topsham (full of memories of our own boyhood, when “a
stranger yet to pain”), and young Exmouth; stately villas and pretty cottages
occupy slopes of the hill range. Then, at Dawlish, a graceful village, we front
the sea, and pass some singular rocks of red sandstone, that stand like sentinels
along the shore&mdash;and here, it may be well to note, some extraordinary inroads
upon the sea-wall of the railway have lately been made by the ocean&mdash;Teignmouth
and Shaldon come next, towns on both sides of the river Teign, connected
by a narrow wooden bridge more than a quarter of a mile in length.
We next arrive at Newton Junction, where a railway branch conducts to
Torquay and Dartmouth; soon afterwards Totnes is reached, an old town on
the Dart, one of the most beautiful of all the rivers in Devonshire, whence a
steamboat issues daily to visit Dartmouth. Here we have left the sea, and
have only in view rich pasture land&mdash;ever green, the hills tree-clad to their
topmost heights. Passing Brent and Kingsbridge Stations, Ivy Bridge next
comes in sight, a deep dell, over which a viaduct passes: a dell of singular
beauty, one of the finest in all Devonshire. Soon we pass Cornwood and
Plympton,&mdash;the latter famous as the birthplace of Sir Joshua Reynolds,&mdash;and,
skirting the Plym, enter Plymouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The eye is at once arrested by a sylvan spot, running out into the sea,
beyond the docks, and their manifold adjuncts; a mass of greenery, unbroken
except by trees of varied foliage, that rise continually in groups, from all parts
of the promontory that, thus seen, seems an island.</p>

<p>The admiral of the “Invincible” Armada had taste, at least, in fixing upon
Mount Edgcumbe as his dwelling-place, when settled in the country he was
“about” to conquer. God’s providence gave the invader a different locality;
and the beautiful domain continues to be, as it was then, the home of the family
of the Edgcumbes, now earls of “that ilk.”</p>

<p>Mount Edgcumbe is in Cornwall; but until recently it was a part of Devonshire;
the Act of Parliament that removed it from one county to the other
dating no further back than 1854. But Acts of Parliament have done
other wonders in this district, for it was only in 1824 that an act was passed
giving to the town of “Plymouth Dock,”&mdash;or, as it was then generally called,
“Dock,”&mdash;the new and more pretentious name which it now holds of <i>Devonport</i>.
The “Mount” is about half a mile across the bay which divides it
from the now “united” towns of Devonport, Stonehouse, and Plymouth, which,
together, contain a population of 150,000 “souls.” From any of the adjacent
heights, especially the Hoe at Plymouth, we obtain a glorious view of the road-stead&mdash;fortified
everywhere. In mid-distance is seen the Breakwater, one of
the marvels of engineering art; and far off, yet within view, the famous lighthouse&mdash;the
Eddystone, some fourteen miles from the nearest shore. Between
these objects and the port are, at all times, many ships of the navy: they rule
the waves of ocean in the seas that encircle earth; and Plymouth will be
especially glorified when the triumphs of British sailors, from the admiral to
the able seaman, supply subjects of discourse.</p>

<p>The Breakwater, one of the most gigantic works in the kingdom, lies in
Plymouth Sound, where it forms a line between Bovisand Bay on the east, and
Cawsand Bay on the west. It is about three miles from Plymouth, and is a
mile in length. In form it is a straight line, with a kant or arm at each end,
branching off towards the shore. At its eastern end a clear passage between it
and the Bovisand shore of about a mile in width is left for ships, while at the
western end the passage is about a mile and a half in width. The idea of the
Breakwater originated with Earl St. Vincent in 1806, and Mr. Rennie and Mr.
Whidbey surveyed the Sound for the purpose. In 1811 the plan was decided
upon. The first stone was deposited on the birthday of the Prince Regent
(afterwards George IV.), 1812. In 1817, and again in 1824, much damage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was done to the progressing work. The quantity of stone used in its formation
is estimated at about four millions of tons, exclusive of about two millions and
a half of tons of granite and other stones used for paving, facings, &amp;c. At the
east end is a beacon, and at the west end a lighthouse 60 feet high. The
spirited engraving of this gigantic undertaking, which we here give, is taken
from Mr. Jewitt’s recently published “History of Plymouth,” where it forms
one of many illustrations. The view, as will be seen, is a kind of bird’s-eye,
and shows the form of the Breakwater, with its new central fort and its lighthouse
and beacon.</p>

<p>The Eddystone Lighthouse, in the English Channel, is fourteen miles from
Plymouth, from which town its light is distinctly visible under favourable
atmospheric circumstances. It is erected on one of the Eddystone rocks, probably
so called from the eddies, or whirls, which surround them. The rocks
themselves are completely covered at high tide. The first attempt to erect a
lighthouse on these rocks was made by Mr. Winstanley in 1696. This was
completed in about four years, but was washed away in a hurricane. In 1706
a new lighthouse, for which an Act of Parliament had been passed, was begun
to be erected by Mr. John Rudyerd, silk mercer, of London, who was of the
famous family of Rudyerd, of Rudyerd, in the county of Stafford, and a man
of considerable engineering and architectural skill. He, wishing to profit by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
experience, determined that as the former lighthouse had been angular, his
should be round, and that as it was mainly of stone his should be of wood.
In 1709 Rudyerd’s lighthouse was completed, and gave promise of being a
great success. Years passed on, storms rose, the waves dashed over and
around it wildly, but it remained firm and unshaken even through the dreadful
tempest of 1744. What wind and water could not do, was, however, soon
after fearfully accomplished by fire&mdash;the lighthouse being burned down in
1755. Immediately after this Mr. Smeaton undertook the task of erecting a
new lighthouse of stone. This, the present Eddystone Lighthouse, was commenced
in 1756 and completed in 1759. In construction it is the most complete
example of architectural and engineering skill. The lower part is solid
throughout, being literally as firm as the rock itself, on which it is immovably
and permanently fixed. The stones are all dovetailed together, so that, in
reality, it becomes but one stone throughout. In the upper portion, which is
equally strong, the rooms and staircase take up the hollow centre. The
lantern is octagonal. This building, which has given to the name of Smeaton
an imperishable fame, bears on its granite cornice the truly appropriate
inscription:&mdash;“Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that
build it. Psalm cxxvii. 1;” and over the lantern, “24th August, 1759.
Laus Deo.” Of this we give an engraving on our initial letter on
page 54.</p>

<p>But we have a theme that demands all the space we can give&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mount Edgcumbe</span>,
and that other seat of the ancient family, <span class="smcap">Cothele</span>.</p>

<p>For Mount Edgcumbe art has done little; but it was here unnecessary for
art to do much: like some women, whose charms of expression and perfect
“loveliness” do not seem to require beauty, this delicious peninsula has been
so richly gifted by Nature, that, perhaps, efforts to enhance its attractions
might have lessened instead of augmenting them. Hill and dell, heights and
hollows, pasture slopes and rugged hillocks, succeed each other with a delicious
harmony we have rarely seen elsewhere. On one side of the bay are the three
busy towns, active with energetic life; on another are the cultivated hill-sides
of productive Devon; on another is the open sea, with the two objects we
have noted&mdash;the Breakwater and the marvellous Eddystone. Everywhere
Nature has had its own sweet will; even the laurel hedges have risen thirty
feet in height; the lime trees grow as if they had never been trimmed; while
the slopes, from the hill-heights to the sea-rocks, appear as sheen as if the
scythe had been perpetually smoothing them. Here and there, pretty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
pleasant shelters have been provided for visitors who throng hither for health
and relaxation;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> “look out” seats are provided on many of the hill-tops; and
the deer and the rabbits have free pasturage in the noble Park that occupies a
space of many hundred acres between the harbour and the sea. Nor may we
forget the “defences” of the peninsula: the battery that would here, as elsewhere,
“keep the foreigner from fooling us,” and that battery called “the
Salute,” in which the huge “Armstrongs” are hidden, but where may be
seen, by all on-lookers, twenty-one mounted cannon&mdash;“prizes” from ships of
“the enemy” taken during the war with France.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>Mount Edgcumbe, from Stonehouse Pier.</i></p>
</div>

<p>All, therefore, is not left to Nature. Nor must we forget the gardens:
prettily laid out; enriched by rare trees, with vases and statues judiciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
intermixed; and, especially, a grove of orange trees, with several summer-houses
in pleasant nooks, where cedars, magnolias, cork trees, and other trees,
supply shade and shelter from rain and sun. Art has here been aiding Nature,
but its influence is felt rather than seen; those to whom the “grounds” owe
much seem to have been ever mindful that their profuse and natural luxuriance
needed few checks of the pruner and trainer. The name of one of these benefactors
is recorded&mdash;a votive urn contains a tablet to the memory of that
countess “whose taste embellished these retreats, herself their brightest ornament”&mdash;Countess
Sophia, who could not have found on earth a home more
lovely than that which, in 1806, she was called to leave for one still more
perfect and more beautiful.</p>

<p>The great charm of Mount Edgcumbe, however, consists in the five-mile
drive through the Park, along a road that everywhere skirts the harbour or the
sea. It is perpetual hill and dell; a mimic ruin, intended as a view tower, and
answering its purpose well, is the only object remarkable on the higher
grounds, if we except the church&mdash;Maker Church&mdash;neither venerable nor picturesque,
but containing many interesting memorials of the Edgcumbe family;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
but down in the dales (in nearly all of them) are the pretty “lodges,” where
the keepers and gardeners reside, and where simple “refreshments” of milk
and hot water are provided for the crowds who are weekly visitors to the
domain. One of these we have pictured on page 64.</p>

<p>Lady Emma’s cottage&mdash;Lady Emma being the first Countess of Mount
Edgcumbe, wife of George, first Baron and Earl of that title&mdash;is charmingly
situated in one of the most lovely of the dells of this domain, surrounded by
soft grassy turf, and overhung by lofty trees; the cottage itself is completely
embosomed in creeping plants, and has a rustic verandah exquisitely decorated
with fir-cones and other natural productions, so disposed as to give considerable
richness to the effect of the building. The little valley in which it stands,
hollowed out with great regularity by Nature, and sloping gently down towards
the sea, is one of the sweetest spots on the whole estate. The footway winds
round the upper part of the valley, and at the head of the dell is a spacious
alcove composed of Gothic fragments, called the “Ruined Chapel,” from which
a glorious view is obtained.</p>

<p>In the grounds the most famous points for the attraction of visitors are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
“Thomson’s Seat;” the “Temple of Milton;” a recess called the “Amphitheatre;”
a charming alcove, the “White Seat,” which commands a splendid
prospect; “the Arch,” which overlooks the Sound; and the “zig-zag walks,”
which lead down along the cliffs and through the woods, and are the favourite
resorts of visitors.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Mansion.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The gardens are three in number, and called respectively the “Italian,”
the “French,” and the “English” gardens, in each of which the special
characteristics of planting and arrangement of those countries are carried out&mdash;the
conservatories, fountains, orangeries, terraces, etc., being, in each instance,
built in accordance with the tastes of the three kingdoms.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is difficult to convey an idea of the grandeur, beauty, and
interest of the views from every portion of the Park; they are perpetually
varied as the eye turns from sea to shore, and from shore to sea; each one of
them enhanced by ships at anchor or in full sail; while boats of all forms and
sizes are continually passing to and fro. One of the most prominent objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
from the park is Drake’s Island; an island in mid-channel between Plymouth
and Mount Edgcumbe; it appears on the map, however, as St. Nicholas
Island, its original name, but it has, in later times, been occasionally called
Drake’s Island, after the great admiral, Sir Francis Drake&mdash;one of the many
sea-heroes of whom Plymouth is justly proud. This island is connected with
the shore at Mount Edgcumbe by a submarine ridge of rocks, called the
“Bridge,” which renders the passage, on that side, dangerous to ships of even
moderate burthen. On the island was formerly an ancient chapel, dedicated
to St. Michael, which was converted in the fifteenth century into a bulwark.
The island contains about three acres of land, and is strongly fortified.</p>

<p>We turn our backs on the Breakwater and distant Eddystone, to mark the
steamer passing under the most remarkable effort of engineering skill in
England&mdash;one of the legacies of Brunel&mdash;the “Albert Bridge” that crosses the
Tamar from Devonshire into Cornwall; and long to visit (which we may easily
do, for steam-boats run daily up it in summer) the beautiful river Tamar and its
grand tributary, the Tavy. A drive of a mile, and before us is a continuation
of the promontory, still charming; and a little farther on, but across the river
Lynher&mdash;and adjacent to the ancient borough of St. Germans, with its venerable
church, once the cathedral of the See of Cornwall&mdash;is Port Eliot, the residence
of the noble family of Eliot, Earls of St. Germans. In a word, a hundred
points of deep and exciting interest, picturesquely beautiful and historically
interesting, may be seen and “taken note of,” from the several points to which
a drive through the Park conducts.</p>

<p>We give an engraving of the mansion. Parts of it are as old as the reign of
Henry VIII., but its outward signs of remote age are few; it seems built for
comfort; it is thoroughly a domestic house; the rooms are neither large, lofty,
nor stately; but all of them are made to live in&mdash;so many parts of a home.
We may except the Great Hall, however; that is “grand.” There is a
minstrels’ gallery, and it is often used for music. The house is square in
general form, and originally had a circular tower at each angle; these,
however, have been rebuilt of an octagonal form, and additions have been
carried in different directions. The front faces down a grassy slope to the sea
at Cremill, and thus a charming prospect is always before its windows;
the rooms are full of family and historic portraits: some of them by the
great old masters, many by Sir Joshua Reynolds, “dear Knight of Plympton,”
while ten or twelve Vanderveldes grace the several apartments.
Of these some are stated to have been painted by the artist, Vandervelde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
himself, at Mount Edgcumbe. Of one, which formed the subject of correspondence
between Sir Richard Edgcumbe and the artist, the original and
amended sketches hang beside the picture. The portraits by Sir Joshua
Reynolds are of individuals of three generations, and those by Lely are in his
best style. Among the national pictures are full-length and other portraits of
Charles I., Charles II., James II., Prince Rupert, William III., the Duke of
Monmouth, and others.</p>

<p>It is needless to add that delicious views are obtained from the windows of
all the leading chambers, not only on the upper but on the ground floors, as
well as from the several terraces by which the dwelling is, on all sides,
environed&mdash;occupying as it does an elevation on the side of one of the hill
slopes.</p>

<p>Before we visit <span class="smcap">Cothele</span>&mdash;the other mansion of the Mount-Edgcumbes&mdash;we
give some account of the ancient and long-honoured family, who have been
their lords for many hundred years.</p>

<p>The family of Edgcumbe, or Edgcomb, is one of the most ancient and
venerable in the county of Devon, the name being derived from their original
possession of Eggescomb, Egecomb, or Edgcombe (now called Lower
Edgcumbe), in the parish of Milton Abbots, in that county. From this family
and this place, the noble family of the Earls of Mount Edgcumbe is descended
as a younger branch.</p>

<p>In 1292 Richard Edgcumbe was Lord of Edgcumbe, in Milton Abbots, and
he was direct ancestor, both of the present representative of the main line, who
is twentieth in direct lineal descent, and of the present ennobled family, as
well as of the branches settled in Kent and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward III., William de Eggescombe, or Edgcombe, second
son of the House of Edgcumbe, having married Hilaria, sole daughter and
heiress of William de Cothele, of Cothele, or Coteel, in the parish of Calstock,
in Cornwall, a fine old Cornish family, became possessed of Cothele and the
other estates, and removed into Cornwall. Here, at Cothele, he and his
descendants resided for several generations.</p>

<p>Richard Edgcumbe, great grandson of William de Edgcumbe and Hilaria de
Cothele, is said to have built the greater part of the grand old residence of
Cothele as it remains at the present day: of this singular mansion we shall
furnish some details. At Bosworth Richard Edgcumbe received the honour of
knighthood from his victorious leader, Henry VII., was made comptroller of
his household, and one of his Privy Council, and had the castle and lordship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of Totnes, in Devonshire&mdash;forfeited to the crown on the attainder of John
Lord Zouch for high treason&mdash;conferred upon him by that monarch, with
many other honours and dignities, and large extents of land, including those
of Sir Henry Bodrugan, who had likewise been attainted for high treason. He
also held, as he had previously done, the offices of Recorder, and Constable of
the castle of Launceston, and Constable of Hertford, &amp;c. In 1488 Sir Richard
was sent into Ireland, as Lord Deputy, by his royal master, to take the oaths
of allegiance of the Irish people, embarking at Mounts Bay in the <i>Anne of
Fowey</i>, and attended by other ships, and a retinue of five hundred men. He
died in 1489, at Morlaix, while holding the appointment of ambassador to
France. He married Joan, daughter of Thomas Tremaine of Collacombe, by
whom he had issue.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Lady Emma’s Cottage.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Of Sir Richard Edgcumbe, Fuller tells a romantic story. He says he was
“memorable in his generation for being zealous in the cause of Henry, Earl of
Richmond, afterwards King Henry VII. He was, in the time of Richard III.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
so hotly pursued, and narrowly searched for, that he was forced to hide
himself in his wood, at his house, in Cuttail, in Cornwall. Here extremity
taught him a suddain policy, to put a stone in his capp and tumble the same
into the water, whilst these rangers were fast at his heels, who, looking down
after the noise, and seeing the cap swimming therein, supposed that hee had
desperately drowned himself, and deluded by this honest fraud, gave over
their further pursuit, leaving him at liberty to shift over into Brittany. Nor
was his gratitude less than his ingenuity, who, in remembranse of his delivery,
after his return built a chappel (which still remains) in the plase where he
lurked, and lived in great repute with prince and people.” After thus cleverly
misleading his pursuers, Richard Edgcumbe crossed the Channel in a small
ship, to the Earl of Richmond, in Brittany, with whom he afterwards returned
to England, and was engaged in the battle of Bosworth Field, in Leicestershire,
where King Richard was killed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>His son, Piers Edgcumbe, was Sheriff of the county of Devon, 9th, 10th,
and 13th Henry VII. and 2nd Henry VIII. “At the creation of Prince
Arthur he was one of the twenty individuals who were made Knights of the
Cross of St. Andrew.” He, with others, was “appointed to review and array
all men at arms, archers, and others, who were to accompany Sir Thomas
D’Arcy in his expedition against the Moors and infidels.” He was one of the
expedition into France, 5th Henry VIII., and for his distinguished gallantry at
the sieges of Tournay and Thurovenne, and at the battle of Spurs, he was
created a knight-banneret. Sir Piers Edgcumbe was married twice: first to
the daughter and heiress of Stephen Durnford, by his wife the heiress of
Rame; and, second, to Katherine, daughter of Sir John St. John, and widow
of Sir Griffith Ap Rys, by whom he had no issue. By the first of these
marriages, Sir Piers Edgcumbe acquired the manors and estates of the
Durnfords, including that of West Stonehouse (now Mount Edgcumbe). He
had issue by her, three sons, Richard, John, and James, and three daughters,
Elizabeth, Jane, and Agnes (or Anne). Sir Piers Edgcumbe died in 1539, and
was succeeded as heir by his eldest son, Richard Edgcumbe, who was knighted
in 1536.</p>

<p>This Sir Richard Edgcumbe built the present family mansion, on a part of
the estate which his father had acquired by marriage with the heiress of the
Durnfords (who had inherited it from the ancient family of Stonehouse or
Stenhouse), and gave to it the name of “Mount Edgcumbe.” He was Sheriff
of Devon 35th Henry VIII. and 1st Queen Mary. He married first a daughter
of Sir John Arundel, by whom he had no issue; and, second, Winifred Essex,
and by her had, besides other issue, a son, Piers, or Peter, who succeeded
him. Sir Richard Edgcumbe, who kept up a fine establishment, and at one
time entertained at Mount Edgcumbe the English, Spanish, and Netherlands
admirals, died in 1561. Piers (or Peter) Edgcumbe, who was member of
Parliament, and was also Sheriff of Devon 9th Elizabeth, married Margaret,
daughter of Sir Andrew Lutterell, by whom he had five sons and four
daughters, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard.</p>

<p>Piers Edgcumbe died in 1607, and on his tomb his honours are thus set
forth:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Lief Tenant to my Queen long Time<br />
And often for my Shire and Knighte;<br />
My merit did to Creddit clime,<br />
Still bidinge in my Callinge righte;<br />
By Loyalty my faith was tryede,<br />
Peacefull I liv’d, hopeful I diede.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">His son, Sir Richard Edgcumbe, knighted by James I., was member of Parliament
for Totnes, for Grampound, and for Bossiney; he married Mary,
daughter and heiress of Sir Richard Coteele, or Cottle, of London, and by her,
who died eighteen years before him, had issue, two sons, Piers and Richard,
by the eldest of whom, Piers Edgcumbe, he was succeeded. This gentleman
distinguished himself by his devotion to the royal cause; he “was a master of
languages and sciences, a lover of the king and church, which he endeavoured
to support in the time of the civil wars to the utmost of his power and fortune.”
Sir Alexander Carew and Major Scawen, for holding connection with Piers
Edgcumbe, who held a colonel’s commission in the king’s army, were beheaded.
He married Mary, daughter of Sir John Glanvil, and died in 1660, being succeeded
by his eldest son, Sir Richard Edgcumbe, who had been knighted
during his father’s lifetime. He was also a member of Parliament. He
married Anne Montague, daughter of Edward, Earl of Sandwich, by whom he
had issue two sons, Piers, who died young and unmarried, and Richard; and
six daughters. He died in 1688.</p>

<p>To this time, for several generations, it will have been noticed, the
inheritors of the estate alternated, in name, between Piers (or Peter) and
Richard. This succession of name was now broken by the death of Piers, the
eldest son.</p>

<p>Richard Edgcumbe, soon after coming of age, was chosen M.P. for Cornwall,
and continued to sit for various places until 1742. In 1716 and 1720
he was one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and in 1724 was
Vice-Treasurer, and Paymaster of the Taxes, &amp;c. In 1742 he was created
<span class="smcap">Baron Edgcumbe</span> of Mount Edgcumbe, and was afterwards made Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster, one of the Privy Council, and Lord-Lieutenant of
Cornwall. His lordship, by his wife Matilda, daughter of Sir Henry Furnese,
had issue, three sons, Richard, Henry (who died an infant), and George;
he died in 1758, and was succeeded in his title and estates by his eldest son,
Richard, second Baron Edgcumbe, member of Parliament for various
places, one of the Lords of the Admiralty, and afterwards appointed Comptroller
of his Majesty’s Household. He was a man of great talent, and is thus
spoken of by Horace Walpole in his “Royal and Noble Authors:”&mdash;“His lordship’s
skill as a draughtsman is said to have been such as might entitle him to
a place in the ‘Anecdotes of English Painting,’ ‘while the ease and harmony
of his poetic compositions give him an authorised introduction here.’ ... ‘a
man of fine parts, great knowledge, and original wit, who possessed a light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and easy vein of poetry; who was calculated by nature to serve the public, and
to charm society; but who unhappily was a man of pleasure, and left his gay
associates a most affecting example how health, fame, ambition, and everything
that may be laudable in principle or practice, are drawn into and
absorbed by that most destructive of all whirlpools&mdash;gaming.’”</p>

<p>His lordship,
dying unmarried in 1761, was succeeded by his brother George as third baron.
This nobleman, who had sat in several parliaments, and held various public
offices (among them the Lord-Lieutenancy of Cornwall), and was Vice-Admiral of
the Blue, married Emma, only daughter and heiress of John Gilbert, Archbishop
of York, by whom he had issue an only son, who succeeded him. His lordship
was, on the 17th February, 1781, created in addition to his title of Baron
Edgcumbe, <i>Viscount Mount Edgcumbe and Valletort</i>; and in 1789 he was
further advanced to the dignity of an earl, by the title of <i>Earl of Mount Edgcumbe</i>.
Dying in 1795, he was succeeded by his only son, Richard, as second
earl.</p>

<p>This nobleman, who also held the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Cornwall,
married Lady Sophia Hobart, daughter of John, second Earl of Buckinghamshire,
and by her had issue, two sons, Ernest Augustus, and George, and
two daughters. His lordship died in 1839, and was succeeded by his eldest
son, Ernest Augustus, as third earl, who (born in 1797) was Aide-de-Camp to
the Queen and Colonel of the Cornwall militia. He married, in 1831, Caroline
Augusta, daughter of Rear-Admiral Charles Feilding, who still survives him,
and is an extra Lady of the Bed-chamber to the Queen. By her his lordship
had issue two sons: viz., William Henry and Charles Ernest, and two
daughters, of whom Ernestine Emma Horatia is still living. The earl died in
1861, and was succeeded by his eldest son as fourth earl.</p>

<p>The present nobleman, William Henry Edgcumbe, fourth Earl of Mount
Edgcumbe, Viscount Mount Edgcumbe and Valletort, and Baron Edgcumbe of
Mount Edgcumbe, the noble owner of Mount Edgcumbe and of the large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
estates concentrated in the family, was born in 1832. He was educated at
Harrow, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he became B.A. in 1856, and
sat as M.P. for the borough of Plymouth from 1859 to 1861, when, by the
death of his father, he entered the Upper House. His lordship is an extra
Lord of the Bed-chamber to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales; is Lieutenant-Colonel
of the 2nd battalion and Captain Commandant of the 16th corps of Devon Rifle
Volunteers; is a Special Deputy Warden of the Stannaries, &amp;c., &amp;c. He
married in 1858 the Lady Katherine Elizabeth Hamilton, fourth daughter of
the first Duke of Abercorn, and has by her issue one son, Piers Alexander
Hamilton Edgcumbe Viscount Valletort (born 1865), and three daughters,
Victoria Frederica Caroline, born 1859, Albertha Louisa Florence, born 1861,
and Edith Hilaria, born 1862. His lordship is patron of five livings; viz.,
Dittisham and Beer Ferrers, in Devonshire; and Landrake, Rame, and Millbrook,
in Cornwall. The arms of the Earl of Mount Edgcumbe are&mdash;<i>gules</i>, on
a bend <i>ermines</i>, cottised, <i>or</i>, three boars’ heads, <i>argent</i>. Crest&mdash;a boar, statant,
<i>argent</i>, gorged with a leaf of oak, <i>vert</i>, fructed, <i>or</i>. Supporters&mdash;two greyhounds,

<p>From the ancient mansion at Mount Edgcumbe we proceed to that which
is still older and more venerable&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="c70" id="c70">Cothele</a>.</span>&mdash;It is difficult to imagine a house continuing&mdash;and but little changed&mdash;to
be inhabited by the same family, or, indeed, inhabited at all, during a period
approaching three centuries; yet that is the case with Cothele, pride of the
beautiful river Tamar, and one of the “gems” of Cornwall;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> its gigantic oaks,
and chestnuts are obviously so old; but it is requisite to examine the exterior,
and especially the interior, to obtain conviction that the mansion dates from the
reign of the seventh Henry; while its present lord is the lineal representative of
the knight who built it&mdash;Sir Richard Edgcumbe&mdash;whose house it is we see,
nearly as he left it:<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but, also, we may examine the armour he wore, for it still
hangs in this hall; the table at which he feasted (the worm of time only has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
touched it); the chairs on which he and his dame sat, the very bed on which
they slept, while the tapestry, woven by fair hands that have been dust for
three centuries, still cover the old walls. Charles I. certainly slept in one of
these rooms, and it demands no great stretch of imagination to believe that the
illustrious Sir Walter Raleigh was often its honoured guest. We may have
been seated in the very chair in which the great knight recounted his adventurous
exploits against the hated Spaniards under his cousin’s roof-tree.
Memories haunt every room; every hole and corner, so to speak, has a tale to
tell of the long past.</p>

<p>The house is one of the finest remaining examples of the period to which it
belongs, and, with Haddon Hall, in Derbyshire, which it closely resembles in
general plan and in some of its details, is one of the best existing specimens of
mediæval domestic architecture in England. Although, doubtless, the greater
part of the building was erected by Sir Richard Edgcumbe, it is evident that the
whole was not built by him, but that he added to, and enlarged the then
family residence of the Cotheles, many portions of which exist at the present
time.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The buildings surround two court-yards, or quadrangles, the entrance
being surmounted by an embattled tower; the main buildings and large tower
are also embattled.</p>

<p>The banqueting-hall is a noble apartment, 42 feet long by 22 feet wide.
It has a remarkably fine timber roof, with intersecting arches in its compartments.
At the upper end, to the left, the lord’s table stood beneath the bayed
window, and opposite to it a doorway leads to the principal staircase. At the
bottom of the hall are three doorways, one of which led to the great kitchen,
and the other two to the buttery and the cellar. On the walls are suits of
armour, helmets, breastplates, warders’ horns, gauntlets, matchlocks, cross-bows,
shields, battle-axes, halberts, pikes, swords, pistols, gisarmes, petronels,
and two-handed swords and spears that may have been</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Bathed in gore</p>
<p class="pp6">On the plains of Azincourt.”</p>

<p class="pn1">In the windows are the royal arms, the arms and impalements of Edgcumbe,
Cothele, Holland, Tremaine, Trenchard, Durnford, Rame, Cotterell, Raleigh
(for Sir Walter Raleigh’s grandmother was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Edgcumbe of Cothele), Trevanion (Sir William Trevanion married another
daughter of Sir Richard Edgcumbe, and fought by his side at Bosworth
Field, and accompanied him in his pursuit of the mutual enemy, Sir Henry
Bodrugan), Carew, of Anthony (of the family of Carew the historian), St.
Maur, Courtenay, Bigbury, Fitzwalter, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The dining-room is a charming tapestried apartment, with mullioned
windows and a fine old fire-place. The tapestry is highly interesting, one of
the subjects being the story of Eurydice, another Diana and Apollo, and the
others rural scenes, equestrian figures, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Adjoining the dining-room is an ante-room of surpassing interest. “The
tapestry in this room represents the Sciences, and might be called the school
of Athens, from the similarity of the subject to the celebrated picture of
Raphael.” In this room, as in others, has been collected together a fine
assemblage of old earthenware and other interesting matters relating to the
life of the inmates in times of old.</p>

<p>The chapel, which is in the corner of the court-yard, contains a pretty
open-work oak screen, and an arched roof at the intersections of which are
carved bosses. The bowl of the original font is preserved. In the east
window, in stained glass, are considerable portions of full-length figures,
probably of saints, but the names do not appear, while in the upper light is
represented the Annunciation. The angel is red with green wings, and on a
label, in black letter, the words “Ave Maria gracia plena, D̄ns tecum.” The
Virgin is on the other side, near a building resembling a church, with a label
also, on which once was “Ecce ancilla D̄ni; fiat ̄mi s̄cdm verbū-tuū.” In the
lower compartment of the window will be noticed three shields of arms: the
first being Edgcumbe, quartering Tremaine (or Trenchard); the second, first,
and fourth Edgcumbe, second Holland, third Tremaine, impaling first and
fourth Durnford, second Fitzwalter, and third, now blank but probably
originally containing Bigbury; and the third which contained Edgcumbe and
several quarterings, much injured. In the south window are two female
saints, St. Ann and St. Katherine. “An ancient altar-piece has the date
1589, and in the centre the adoration of the Magi; while on one door is the
portrait of a man with ‘æt suæ 38,’ and on the other of a female, with ‘æt suæ
28,’ and on each door a shield with <i>or</i>, an arrow, <i>sable</i>.” The chapel is
entered from the dining-room as well as from the court-yard and domestic
offices. It has a small bell turret.</p>

<p>The bed-rooms&mdash;“the white room,” the “red room,” the “best room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>”
“King Charles’s room,” and “Queen Anne’s room”&mdash;are all hung with fine
tapestry, and furnished in a style strictly in keeping with the place itself.
The ceiling of the first of these is of geometric design. The carved furniture
in these rooms is of the most interesting character, and among the decorations
are many shields of arms of the Edgcumbes and their alliances. The tapestry
is of the finest character, the furniture grand as old furniture well can be, the
hangings rich in material and hoary with age, and the ornaments of the most
veritable <i>vertu</i> character&mdash;each room in this grand old mansion offers subject-matter
enough for a separate volume.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Mansion.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The drawing-room is also a fine tapestried apartment, furnished with
massive ebony chairs, ebony sofa, and ebony carved cabinet, and all the
appliances <i>en suite</i>. The kitchen and the other domestic offices are each and
all of the most interesting character, and convey to the mind a vivid picture of
the life of the inmates in days gone by. It is impossible, indeed, to conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
anything better than Cothele as an illustration of the home-life of our
mediæval ancestors; for the building, the furniture, and the appliances, as they
are to-day, so were they three hundred years ago. As it was in the days of
Henry VII., so it is in those of Queen Victoria; and so, thanks to the
preserving spirit of the Edgcumbes, it is likely to remain for centuries to
come.</p>

<p>On some of the previous pages mention is made of Sir Richard Edgcumbe’s
escape from his pursuers, and of his founding a chapel on the spot of
his deliverance. This little chapel still stands to mark the spot, and to bring
back to the mind the circumstances of his escape, and of the discomfiture of
his pursuers. The chapel is built on the edge of the rock overlooking the
water, and from the east window the view is wonderfully grand. In this east
window is a figure of St. George in the centre, with the Annunciation and the
Crucifixion on either side. It also bears the arms of Edgcumbe and Tremaine.
In the other windows are also figures in stained glass, and on the altar is a
triptych. Among other interesting features in this chapel&mdash;and they are many&mdash;is
a fac-simile of the ancient tomb of Sir Richard Edgcumbe, at Morlaix.</p>

<p>The grounds are charmingly wild, yet graceful. Nature is in a great
degree left to have her own way; the trees are of magnificent size (one of
them indeed measures 28 feet in girth), ferns and wild flowers grow in rich
luxuriance: every now and then glimpses are obtained of the beautiful river,
and, on the opposite side, of the hill-steeps and thick woods of Devonshire.
A pretty landing-place for boats is among the most picturesque points in the
landscape; a lesser river here flows into the Tamar; a waterfall adds to the
interest of the scene; and a neat little inn, close to the bank, gives refreshment
to the wayfarer; above all its attractions is to be counted this&mdash;it is distant a
dozen miles from a railway, and the shrill whistle never breaks the harmony
of the song-birds, who “cannot help but sing” in every bush, brake, and tree
of the demesne. The scenery on the river in the neighbourhood of Cothele is
extremely beautiful, and in many places thickly overhung by skirting woods.
Danescombe, a deep hollow in the woods, is a charming spot, as are the
Morwell rocks, and many other places.</p>

<p>We have directed attention to but one of a hundred attractions in Devonshire
and Cornwall: Devonshire is rich in the picturesque at all seasons;
and the wild grandeur of the Cornish coast has for centuries been a theme of
special laudation. Here and there, no doubt, other countries may supply us
with finer examples of the sublime and beautiful in scenery; but they are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
be reached only by sacrifices, such as the <span class="smcap">Home Tourist</span> is not called upon to
make: our own Islands have been gifted by God with so much that is refreshing
as well as exciting to the eye and mind, that he or she must be fastidious
indeed who fails to be content with the beauties that Nature presents so
“near at hand”&mdash;accessible at comparatively easy cost of time, toil, and
money.</p>

<p>Between Exeter and Plymouth there may be a tour for every day of a
month.</p>

<p>Among the more delightful trips, where all is so beautiful, and where it is
impossible to turn in any direction without finding some delightful place or
some interesting object, may be named as especially within the reach of
visitors, those to Ivy Bridge, with its abundant charms of hill, dell, wood, and
river; to Saltram, the seat of the Earl of Morley, on the banks of the Laira;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the Beacon and moors of Brent; to the picturesque and pleasant dingles
and combs of Cornwood; to Plympton, with its historic sites and its pleasant
associations; to Bickleigh and its poetical vale; to Dartmoor, with its gloomy
waste, its wild and romantic “breaks” of scenery, and its endless antiquities;
and to scores of other delicious spots. The trip up the river Tamar
to the Weir-head is one which ought to be taken by every visitor, embracing,
as it does, besides hundreds of other points of interest, the dockyards, gun-wharf,
Keyham steam-yard, Mount Edgcumbe, Torpoint, Thanckes, Gravesend
House, the mouth of the sweet river Lynher, by which St. Germans is
reached; Saltash, whose women are proverbial for their dexterity and strength
in aquatic exercises, and who often carry off regatta prizes; St. Budeaux,
with its conspicuous church; the junction of the Tavy with the Tamar; Warleigh,
Beer Ferris, and Maristow; Cargreen and Landulph, in whose churchyard
Theodore Palæologus, the last male descendant of the Christian emperors
of Greece, rests in peace; Pentillie Castle, with its romantic love stories and
tales of change of fortune; Cothele, of which we have spoken; Calstock, with
its fine old church situated on a promontory; Harewood House, the seat of
the Trelawneys, and the scene, in Mason’s <i>Elfrida</i>, of the love of Ethelwold
and of the misfortunes consequent on his marriage with the daughter of
Ordgar; and the sublime and beautiful Morwell Rock.</p>

<p>Staddon Heights, Mount Batten, Penlee Point, Hooe, and many other
places, are within short distances of the Hoe, at Plymouth, and can be easily
reached. Trematon Castle and St. John’s are also near at hand, and pleasure
trips are frequently made in steam-boats round the Eddystone.</p>

<p>For those who make a longer stay in South Devon, visits may well be
made to Tavistock, to Totnes, to Berry Pomeroy Castle, to Torquay, with a
long <i>et cetera</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Besides the trip up the Tamar, there are other rivers in South
Devon whose charms are of a totally different, but perhaps even more exquisitely
beautiful character. Thus the Dart, the Lynher, the Plym, the Yealm,
the Erme, and the Tavy, all present attractions to the tourist.</p>

<p>It cannot fail to augment the enjoyment of those who visit this beautiful
county&mdash;the fairest, the brightest, and the “greenest” of all our English shires&mdash;to
recall the many “worthies” to whom Devonshire and Cornwall have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
given birth; men renowned in art, in science, and in letters: and the gallant
men, the “adventurers,” who carried the flag of England into every country
of the world, braving the battle and the breeze in all the seas that surround
earth in the four quarters of the globe. It is a long list&mdash;the names of Drake,
of Raleigh, and of Davy; of Reynolds, Northcote, Haydon, and Eastlake; of
Carew, of Hawkins, and of Gilbert; of Kitto, of Bryant, and of Hawker, being
not a tithe of the eminent men to which this district has given birth&mdash;of whom
the western shires are rightly and justly proud.</p>

<p>Shame be to those who seek in other lands the enjoyment they may find
so abundantly at home&mdash;who talk freely of the graces and grandeurs of far-off
countries, and do not blush to acknowledge entire ignorance of those that bless
and beautify their own.</p>

<p>England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, are, each and all, rich in “the
picturesque;” to the artist and art-lover they present attractions second to
none they will find in any country of the Continent: that is the truest
“patriotism,” which inculcates, as a first duty, a full appreciation of</p>

<p class="dc16">WITH the single exception of Royal Windsor, <span class="smcap">Alnwick
Castle</span> is second to none of the mediæval British
strongholds which, in our own times, combine the
characteristics of the early fortress and the modern
palace. With its magnificent architectural features,
all of them deeply impressed with the attributes of a
baronial castle of the olden time, and placed in the
midst of that famous scene of long-continued strife,
of daring deeds, and of summary retribution, the
Northern Border, Alnwick may truly be said to be an
historical monument, standing upon historic ground.
The names of the great barons, in like manner, who
have successively been lords of Alnwick, have been
enrolled by English chroniclers among the foremost
ranks of their countrymen, so that their own
biographies, interwoven with the history of their renowned
castle, are written in the annals of England. Then, on the
other hand, while in an extraordinary degree rich as well in relics as in
memories of the past, Alnwick still maintains the unclouded splendour of its
ancient dignity in its present capacity as the residence of an existing ducal
family. Thus, from whatever point of view it may be regarded, Alnwick
Castle must be esteemed as one of the finest and most interesting of our
national edifices, and it also always will establish its claim to a foremost place
among “the stately homes of England.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>When Nature declined to provide any one of her own emphatic boundary-lines,
such as a mountain-chain or a broad and deep river, to determine the
frontier which should divide England from Scotland, she left a very delicate
and difficult international question to be adjusted by the rulers of the two
adjacent realms, so long as this single island of Britain should be divided into
two distinct, and by no means necessarily friendly, kingdoms. An artificial
line of demarcation, accordingly, had to be drawn, and was drawn, which was
supposed to be accepted and recognised both to the north and to the south of
it. Here and there, as if to show in the clearest manner possible the
unsatisfactory character of a frontier such as this, to a tract of country the
ominous name of “Debateable Land” was assigned by common consent. On
either side of the frontier-line, again, and including all the “Debateable
Land,” the “Border” stretched far away to both the north and the south;
and, throughout its whole extent, it formed a decidedly exceptional territory,
in which there prevailed a system of wild laws that were administered after a
still wilder fashion: hence, whatever may have been the state of things
between England and Scotland, and between the two sovereigns and the two
nations, along the Border there flourished a chronic local warfare, duly
distinguished by gallant exploits, desperate enterprises, and barbarous devastation,
with the occasional variety of an expedition of sufficient magnitude almost
to constitute a regular campaign, or the formal investment, and perhaps the
storm and sack, of some important fortified castle.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The Borderers appear to have become so accustomed to this kind of life,
that they looked upon it as their proper lot, and after a manner even regarded
it with a kind of grim approval. Among them, doubtless, there were but too
many who were thoroughly in earnest in their devotion to what may be styled
the Border system&mdash;men</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Stout of heart and steady of hand,”</p>

<p class="pn1">who, living in the constant expectation of some sudden assault, were both
“good at need,” and ready and resolute at all times to take advantage to the
utmost of every promising opportunity for successfully and profitably assaulting
their hostile neighbours. In order to keep a check upon this predatory
warfare, and to maintain something more than the semblance of a supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
constituted authority, certain warlike barons, intrusted with high powers as
Lords Wardens, were established in fortified castles of great strength along the
line of the Border, and in those northern districts of England which adjoined
it. Of these early strongholds one of the proudest and the sternest was the
Castle of Alnwick.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Plan of Alnwick Castle.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Distant from London, north by west, 313 miles (by railway), Alnwick, the
county-town of Northumberland, is pleasantly situated on high ground, rising
about 200 feet above the sea-level, on the south bank of the river Aln. From
the name of this river, with the addition of <i>wick</i>, a place of human habitation,
<span class="smcap">Alnwick</span>, always pronounced by its native inhabitants “Annick,” is evidently
derived.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Alnwick Castle, from the River Aln.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Still remaining but little changed from what it was in times long
passed away, while from the humblest of origins other towns have grown up
and increased until they have attained to great magnitude and wealth and
importance, Alnwick derives its interest from its early association with our
national history&mdash;an association blended with the connection of the town with
its castle, and with the great barons, the lords of that castle. The site of the
castle and town of Alnwick is of a character which necessarily leads to the
conclusion, that it must have been occupied both by a settlement and by some
stronghold from a very remote period; and this opinion is confirmed by the
presence of numerous relics in the immediate neighbourhood, that may be
assigned without hesitation to ages anterior to the Roman settlement in
Britain: the authentic history of Alnwick, however, cannot be carried back
further than the era of the Norman Conquest, and even then for awhile more
than a little of uncertainty overshadows the earliest pages of the chronicle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
There exists no evidence to show that in the year 1066 any castle was standing
at Alnwick; nor have we any knowledge of what lords may have held the
high ground on the southern bank of the Aln during the Anglo-Saxon rule.</p>

<p>On Alnwick Moor, and in many places in the neighbourhood, are some
remarkably interesting camps and other earth-works, and also some barrows,
in which various relics have been discovered. In one of these was found a
stone cist, containing a skeleton in the usual contracted position of Celtic
interments; and in another, in a similar cist, was found a fine food-vessel,
ornamented with a lozenge pattern. In other barrows Celtic remains,
including cinerary urns, drinking-cups, food-vessels, flints, celts, and other
implements of stone, bronze daggers, &amp;c., have been found, and prove incontestably
the early occupation of the site of Alnwick. In the neighbourhood,
too, occur many of those curious remains of antiquity, sculptured stones,
bearing circles and other rude and singular characters, which are supposed to
be inscriptions.</p>

<p>It may be accepted as probable that the first Norman by whom this barony
was held was Gilbert Tyson, standard-bearer of the Conqueror, the kind of
personage who very naturally would be intrusted with the charge of a remote
and turbulent northern district. His descendants continued to hold some
estates under the lords of Alnwick in the reign of Edward III., but there is no
foundation for the legend that the barony of Alnwick passed to Yvo de Vesci
by his marriage with Alda, a granddaughter of Gilbert Tyson. Still, by
whatever means he may have acquired possession, Yvo de Vesci was lord of
Alnwick about the year 1096; and he also is the first Norman baron of this
barony whose history, scanty as it is, rises above doubt and speculation. He
died about the year 1134, leaving, without any male issue, an only daughter,
Beatrix, his sole heiress.</p>

<p>Before we pass on to trace the fortunes of the descendants of Yvo de Vesci,
a brief notice must be taken of a memorable incident which took place in the
immediate neighbourhood of Alnwick before Yvo himself had become its lord.
After the Norman Conquest many of the Anglo-Saxon nobles found a sympathizing
refuge to the north of the Border, under the protection of Malcolm
Caenmore, or “great head,” King of Scotland, whose queen was an Anglo-Saxon
princess, being sister to Edgar Atheling. Malcolm, in his zeal for the
fallen Anglo-Saxon dynasty, five times made incursions into Northumberland,
laid waste the country far and wide with fire and sword, and carried away
almost the entire adult population as slaves into Scotland. This devastating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
warfare was suspended in consequence of a treaty, during the concluding
years of the reign of the Conqueror; but it broke out afresh after the
succession of Rufus, and Malcolm, accompanied by Prince William, his eldest
son, in person led an expedition as far south as Alnwick; and there, on the
13th of November, 1093, the king himself fell in an ambuscade, his son at the
same time was mortally wounded, and the Scottish army was dispersed by
Earl Robert de Mowbray, the governor of Bamborough Castle. The body of
Malcolm, having rested about thirty years at Tynemouth, was removed and
re-interred at Dunfermline by his son Alexander. There still remain two
fragments of a rude memorial cross, which, from an early period, has marked
the spot assigned by tradition to the scene of Malcolm’s discomfiture and
death; and, in 1774, one of his descendants, Elizabeth, Duchess of Northumberland,
erected on the same spot another cross, designed in accordance
with the debased architectural taste of that period.</p>

</div>

<p>The one circumstance connected with the career of Yvo de Vesci that has
come down to us is the fact that he began to build the earliest parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
existing castle of Alnwick. With the barony, the castle of Alnwick passed to
Eustace Fitz-John by his marriage with Beatrix, the heiress of Yvo de Vesci.
In the hands of this able baron, Alnwick Castle was “most strongly fortified:”
he also founded the monastery of Alnwick, and in 1157 was succeeded by his
eldest son, William, who, in honour of his mother, assumed the name of De
Vesci. In the time of this baron, another King of Scotland found that the
neighbourhood of Alnwick Castle was no place of safety. In the year 1174
William the Lion, while besieging the fortress of the De Vescis, was taken
prisoner, and the large army under his command was completely routed, De
Vesci himself taking an active part in the fierce struggle. His descendant,
John De Vesci, who died in 1288, leaving no issue, founded and endowed
Hulne Abbey; and he was the first baron of his house who was summoned by
the king to the parliament by writ, his predecessors having been barons by
tenure. William De Vesci III., one of the claimants of the Scottish crown,
was born in 1245, and succeeded to the barony of Alnwick on the death of his
brother. The last baron of Alnwick of his race, he died in 1297, without
legitimate issue, having infeoffed the celebrated Anthony Bec, Bishop of Durham,
with all his lands and his castle of Alnwick, to hold them in trust for an
illegitimate son. But in 1309 the bishop sold the castle and barony of Alnwick
to Henry de Percy; and this conveyance was confirmed by Edward II. in
1310.</p>

<p>Deriving, as it would seem, their memorable name from that district in
Normandy in which from an early period, long before the Norman Conquest of
England, their family had been established, the <span class="smcap">Percies</span> were represented in
the ranks of the Conqueror at Hastings by William de Percy, who assumed the
additional name of Le Gernons, or Algernon, as a personal epithet denoting
the mass of hair which he wore about his face. About 1166, or almost an
exact century after the battle of Hastings, the wealth, dignities, and power of
the Percies centred in an heiress who, perhaps in 1168, married Josceline de
Louvain, second son of the Duke of Brabant, and half-brother to the second
queen of Henry I. of England. A legend has been preserved, which relates
that on her marriage with Josceline, Agnes de Percy stipulated that her husband,
at his own option, should assume either the arms or the name of Percy;
and it is added that the bridegroom elected to retain his own arms, the blue
lion rampant of Brabant, while he assumed the paternal surname of his bride.
This legend, however, must be regarded as the poetic offspring of a later age,
since at the time of the marriage of Agnes de Percy armorial insignia had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
neither assumed any definite character, nor had any such insignia become
hereditary.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Prudhoe Tower and Chapel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There is nothing to show that Josceline de Louvain ever bore the
name of Percy; but it is certain that the surname of his mother was assumed
and borne by the second son of Josceline’s marriage with the Percy heiress,
Henry de Percy; and by his descendants and successors the same name was
regularly borne. It was Sir Henry de Percy, third of the name, who in 1309,
the second year of Edward II., when already he was possessed of vast wealth,
and great power, became the <i>first Lord of Alnwick of the House of Percy</i>, by
purchase from Bishop Anthony Bec. Having taken an active part in the wars
with Scotland and otherwise distinguished himself among the foremost men of
his time, Henry, first Baron Percy of Alnwick, died in 1315, and was buried
at Fountains Abbey, to which institution he had been a munificent benefactor.
One of the powerful barons who signed the memorable letter to Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Boniface VIII., in which the peers of England refused to recognise or allow the
interference of Papal authority with the independent sovereignty of this realm,
he married Eleanor Fitz-Alan, daughter of Richard, Earl of Arundel, by whom
he had two sons, and of these the elder, another Henry de Percy, succeeded
his father as second Baron Percy of Alnwick, to whom was granted by
Edward III. the castle and manor of Warkworth “for service in peace and
war,” as appears from the original grant now in the Duke of Northumberland’s
possession. This Lord Percy was interred at Alnwick Abbey, the only head
of the family buried in Northumberland. The history of the lords of Alnwick
from this period becomes so closely interwoven with the history of England, that
it would be superfluous in such a sketch as the present to attempt to introduce
even a slight outline of the career of each of those renowned barons; and,
indeed, if it were desirable, it would not be possible here to find space for the
very slightest outline of so comprehensive a subject. Accordingly, we now are
content to give but little more than the succession of the Percies after they
became lords of Alnwick.</p>

<p>Henry de Percy, eldest son of the first baron, succeeded his father as
second Baron Percy of Alnwick; he died in 1352, leaving, by his wife Idonea
de Clifford (whose magnificent monument, with its rich and splendid architectural
canopy, unsurpassed in England, and also without a rival in its
remarkable condition of preservation, is the pride of Beverley Minster), four
sons, of whom the eldest, Henry, succeeded as third Baron Percy of Alnwick.
This baron died in 1368; his eldest son, by Mary of Lancaster, Henry de
Percy, sixth of his name and fourth baron, was created <span class="smcap">Earl of Northumberland</span>
by Richard II., and High Constable of England. This great noble fell a
victim to the tyranny of Henry IV., at Bramham Moor, in 1409. He was
thrice married: first to Elizabeth, heiress to the Earl of Angus, by whom he
acquired the barony of Prudhoe; secondly to Margaret de Neville; and
thirdly to Maud de Lucy, sister and heiress of Lord Lucy, widow of Gilbert de
Umfraville, and mother of her second husband’s first wife: and by these
alliances the barony of Prudhoe, with the estates of the Lucys and the castle
and honour of Cockermouth, became annexed to the Percy earldom. Sir
Henry de Percy, known by his surname of <span class="smcap">Hotspur</span> as well in song as in
history,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Who was sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride,”</p>

<p class="pn1">the earl’s eldest son, was killed near Shrewsbury in 1403. At Trotton, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Sussex, a fine monumental brass commemorates Elizabeth de Mortimer, wife
of Hotspur, and afterwards of Lord Camoys.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Keep.</i></p>
</div>

<p>After several years the fortified honours and estates of the Percies were
restored to Henry, the son of Hotspur, who thus became the second Earl of
Northumberland. This great earl was killed, fighting under the red-rose
banner, at St. Albans, in 1455; and was succeeded by his fourth surviving
son, by his marriage with Eleanor de Neville, another Henry, who, with one
of his brothers, fell at the disastrous rout of Towton, in 1461. Two other
brothers of this earl died in arms in the Lancastrian cause; one of them, Sir
Ralph de Percy, a few days before the final catastrophe at Hexham in 1464,
was killed fighting bravely on Hedgeley Moor, where a cross was erected as a
memorial of his valour and his fall: of this cross the shaft, adorned with the
heraldic insignia of Percy and Lucy, is still standing. Under the third earl,
who, by his marriage with Eleanor de Poynings, acquired the baronies of
Poynings, Fitzpayne, and Bryan, the estates attached to the earldom reached
their greatest territorial extent, and constituted a vast principality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1469 the attainder of the third earl having been reversed, his only son,
Henry, became the fourth earl; he was killed in a popular tumult in 1489,
when his eldest son, by his marriage with Maud de Herbert, Henry Algernon,
succeeded as fifth earl. Remarkable rather for an almost regal state and
magnificence than for the warlike qualities that before his time had been hereditary
in his house, he was the first Earl of Northumberland who did not fall
in battle or otherwise suffer a violent death. He died in 1527, having married
Catherine Spense, or Spencer. The Household Book of this earl, which has
been published by Bishop Percy, is one of the most remarkable and characteristic
documents that illustrate the personal history of the greatest English
nobles in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His son, the sixth earl, a
second Henry Algernon de Percy, the lover of Anne Boleyn in her earlier and
really happier days, married Mary Talbot, daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury,
but in 1537 died without issue, when the grand Percy earldom became extinct.</p>

<p>Twenty years later, “in consideration of his noble descent, constancy,
virtue, and valour in deeds of arms, and other shining qualifications,” of which
last recommendations to royal favour the fact that he was a zealous Roman
Catholic certainly was not the least influential, Thomas de Percy, eldest son of
the second son of the fifth earl (Sir Thomas Percy), was created by Queen
Mary, Baron Percy, and also restored to the earldom of Northumberland; but
the tenure by which the restored earl was to hold his dignities and lands
restricted the succession absolutely to the heirs male of his own body, and to
those of his brother. This the seventh earl was executed, as a traitor, at
York, in 1572, leaving no surviving son. Accordingly, his brother, Henry de
Percy, became the eighth earl: he died in 1585, having been shot (it was
said, but most doubtfully, by his own hand) while a prisoner in the Tower.
The eldest son of this earl, by Catherine de Neville, Henry, succeeded as
ninth earl: he was a learned, eccentric personage, commonly known as “the
Wizard,” and died, after an imprisonment of fifteen years in the Tower, in
1632. He married Dorothy Devereux, and was succeeded by his eldest son,
Algernon, one of the noblest of his race. This great earl died in 1668, having
married, first, Anne Cecil, and, secondly, Elizabeth Howard. His successor,
his only son (by his second marriage), Josceline de Percy, the eleventh and
last earl of Northumberland of the direct lineage of the Percies, died in 1670,
leaving, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas, Earl of Southampton, an
only child, a daughter, Elizabeth de Percy, four years old at the time of her
father’s death.</p>

<p>Here we pause, before we trace onwards the fortunes of the later lords of
Alnwick, that we may direct our attention to the history of their grandest
northern fortress-home, Alnwick Castle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>Norman Gateway in the Keep.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The plan of the castle, as it exists at the present time, is shown in our
engraving; and it will be seen that five distinct periods in the architectural
history are indicated by varieties of shading introduced into the outlines. The
extreme extent of the walls from east to west slightly exceeds 1,000 feet;
while that from north to south is somewhat less than 600 feet. The varied
outline of the space enclosed within the walls, which in a great measure has
been determined by the nature of the ground, in an infinite degree enhances
the equally noble and picturesque aspect of the edifice. The figures in the
plan refer to the various parts of the castle in the manner following:&mdash;1, is
the Barbican; 2, the Gateway to the second Baly; 3, the Octagonal Towers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
4, the Norman Gateway; 5, the Grand Staircase; 6, the Guard Chamber; 7,
the Principal Ante-Room; 8, the Library; 9, the Saloon; 10, the Drawing-Room;
11, the Dining Hall; 12, the Chapel; 13 and 14, State Bed-Rooms,
15, Boudoir of the Duchess; 16, Kitchen; 17, Estate Offices; 18, Laundry;
19, Guest-Hall; 20, Stables; 21, Riding-School; 22, West Garret; 23,
Abbot’s Tower; 24, Falconer’s Tower; 25, Postern Tower; 26, Constable’s
Tower; 27, Ravine Tower; 28, East Garret; 29, Warder’s Tower; 30,
Auditor’s Tower; 31, Clock Tower; and 32, the Avener’s Tower. Thus, the
open ground within the circumvallation, as will be seen by the plan, is divided
into two irregular spaces, the outer and the inner Baly, the outer being
toward the west. Occupying a central position is the Keep, a grand cluster of
towers and curtain-walls, enclosing an open court-yard: of these towers, the
new Prudhoe Tower, within which is the Library (No. 8), with its lofty
banner-turret, is the most conspicuous. Running south, commencing with
No. 13 and extending to No. 2, a new range of buildings connects the Keep
with the early Percy gateway between the balies, and with the main southern
curtain. In this direction, all the buildings, from No. 29 to No. 17, and from
thence (with the exception of No. 31, which is one of the flanking towers of
the main curtain) to No. 19 southward, and to No. 21 westward, are new, and
they have been erected beyond and without the limits of the proper fortification.
In like manner, the whole line of curtain-wall, from No. 24 to No. 25,
is new. To the north of the Keep the ground falls somewhat rapidly in the
direction of the river; from the bridge which here crosses the Aln, the view of
<span class="smcap">The Castle</span>, as its groups of towers and its far-extending walls rise proudly
above the encircling woods, is particularly fine and impressive.</p>

<p>The principal approach and entrance to the castle are from the west.
Here, to the westward of the original outer face of the fosse, stands the
Barbican; an embattled outwork of equal strength and dignity, the work of
the first of the Percies, about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1310. The rounded arch of the entrance
gateway here is an example of a usage not very uncommon at the period
which has just been specified, and always present in the works of Lord Henry
de Perci. The Barbican, which covers an area of 55 feet in length by 32 feet
in width, is a perfect example of the style of fortification that was held to be
essential for defence against assault in mediæval warfare. One remarkable
feature, which is repeated again and again in various parts of the castle,
cannot fail at once to attract attention when approaching the Barbican; this is
the array of tall figures representing armed warders of the fourteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sculptured in stone, which surmount the parapet, and stand upon the merlons
of the embattling, casting their long shadows upon the grey masonry.</p>

         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Armourer’s Tower.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Having entered the Barbican, passed under the sculptured Percy lion
which keeps guard over the archway, and traversed the entrance tower, we
find ourselves within the enclosure of the first or outer baly; here, turning to
the left, we commence our survey of the castle within the lines of circumvallation.
The curtain-wall, extending from the entrance northwards at a right
angle to the Abbot’s Tower, and having midway a garret or wall-tower (No. 22
in plan) built upon it, is part of the old Norman work of the De Vescis, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
evident tokens of important reparation a little before the middle of the fifteenth
century, by the father of Hotspur, the sixth lord of Alnwick. The Armourer’s
Tower (No. 23 in plan), which occupies the N.W. angle of the <i>enceinte</i>, is a
noble piece of Edwardian architecture; it consists of a vaulted basement, with
two stories above it, connected by a turret-stair: and its external massive
effectiveness is greatly enhanced by the square turret at the N.W. angle of the
tower, which rises boldly above the embattled parapet, having its own merlons
crowned with weather-beaten sculptured warders. Now facing eastwards,
and soon making a slight inclination towards the east, again we follow the
line of the Norman curtain-walls, until we reach the new Falconer’s Tower
(No. 24 in plan), which has been built on the site of the razed early
Armourer’s and Falconer’s Towers; the original curtain apparently extended
in a direct line from No. 24 to the Keep. Passing onwards along the new
curtain-wall due east from No. 24, we follow the line of this wall as it turns
towards the south, and at No. 25 in the plan brings us to the Postern Tower,
another massive relic of the first Lord Percy, placed at the base of the eminence
upon which the Keep stands; this tower protects a postern or sally-port,
and it has a curious staircase in the thickness of its walls: it is now
used as a museum for Roman and British antiquities. Advancing still further
eastwards, but with an inclination to the north, and again following the course
of De Vesci’s curtain, we reach the Constable’s Tower (No. 26 in plan), of
Edwardian architecture, to which there are three external entrances, one in
each floor: one chamber in this tower is used as an armoury. Again, as we
follow the guidance of the curtain-wall towards the S.E., we have before us
the Norman masonry, with traces of Edwardian, or first Percy, reparation.
Here, about midway between Nos. 26 and 27 of the plan, an embattled
projection from the line of the wall has been entitled “Hotspur’s Chair,” and
to the east of this projection a gap in the curtain is filled up with eighteenth-century
masonry; this gap a not very well-supported tradition assigns to a
fierce assault by some Scots, who are said to have been so far successful as to
beat down this portion of the castle-wall, after which exploit the tradition adds
that the assailants were cut off to a man by the garrison. This tower, which
is called both the Ravine Tower and the Record Tower (No. 27 of plan),
stands at the easternmost extremity of the castle; with Edwardian remains in
its walls, it was for the most part rebuilt in the last century: on the ground-floor
is the muniment-room, in which the records are kept. From this point
our course inclines in a south-westerly direction, the curtain being eighteenth-century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
work, until again, at No. 28 in the plan, we welcome traces of the
early masonry: here another garret occurs, with the junction of the Norman
and modern masonry; then yet another succeeds, as once more we follow an
eighteenth-century wall until we reach the new Lion or Garden Gatehouse,
No. 29 in the plan, through which a road leads to Barneyside, where are
situated the extensive and beautiful gardens of the castle.</p>

<div class="floatright">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>On the Barbican.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From within this
gateway, which is flanked by two octagonal towers, one of them&mdash;the
Warder’s Tower&mdash;larger and loftier than the other, the curtain-wall of the first
Lord Percy’s work leads in a direct line nearly
due west; we follow the course of this wall, we
pass through the middle gate-house, erected by
the first of the Percies, which both separates and
connects the inner and the outer baly; again, on
our left, we have early Norman masonry in the
curtain, and then we reach the Auditor’s Tower
(No. 30 in plan), another relic of the first Lord
Percy: here was held the court of the lord of the
barony; here now is the private Library of the
Duke; and here also is the Museum of Egyptian
Antiquities, collected by Duke Algernon, the last
munificent restorer of Alnwick. Still following the
line of the curtain, we reach the Clock Tower.
From this tower, the curtain, built in the last
century, leads in a northerly direction to the
entrance gateway connected with the Barbican, to
which, thus completing our entire circuit, we now
return, having passed, since leaving the Clock
Tower, the Avener’s Tower or Garner (No. 32 of plan), like the adjoining
curtain, a modern work.</p>

<p>During our progress from the garden gate (No. 29 in plan) westward and
northward to the Barbican, we have passed the long ranges of new buildings
that either adjoin or actually abut upon the outer face of the curtain-walls
(Nos. 16 to 21 in plan), by no means unimportant parts of the latest restoration,
which comprise all the domestic offices and the whole stable department of the
castle. These buildings, which have been planned and constructed with the
highest architectural and engineering skill, are on a scale of princely magnitude;
and of them it may truly be said that they leave nothing to be desired. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
one only of these new edifices is it necessary that we should make particular
mention; this is No. 19 on the plan, a noble apartment, covered with an open
timber hammer-beam roof. In consequence of there being in the restored
castle no such baronial hall as invariably formed the principal feature in a
great mediæval stronghold, Duke Algernon built this Guest Hall in its stead,
which might enable himself and his successors to assemble his and their
tenantry and friends to partake of the always splendid hospitality of the
Percies. This hall has also been used for concerts and various other purposes.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Well in the Keep.</i></p>
</div>


<p>From the Barbican we retrace our steps so far as to traverse the roadway
that leads to the inner Gate-House (No. 2 in plan), that we may explore the
magnificent Keep: this, however, is a duty we postpone; pausing for a while,
and resting beneath the tree that grows beside the Barbican. Presently, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
shall resume our biographical sketch, and observe by what means an only
daughter once again became the ancestress of a noble lineage, and through
them brought to the house and castle of the Percies a still more exalted dignity
and a still higher honour than ever before had been attained by them.</p>

</div>

<p>And we rejoice to know that the noble line of the Percies was not destined finally
to fail with a failure of a direct heir male; it also is a subject for rejoicing
that over the towers of Alnwick there still should wave a banner, charged
with the same quarterings that in the olden time were so well known to the
breezes of Northumberland. As it has been well said, Alnwick Castle has
ever been esteemed as the old head-quarters of border chivalry; and, in truth,
it is a subject for national pride to feel it has that same aspect still. No one
assuredly can “look upon this very ‘gudlye howsse,’ as King Harry’s commissioners
called it, or upon its grassy courts fringed with ‘faire towres,’ its
stately keep with its ‘marveylouse fare vaulte’ ‘and tryme ladgings,’” as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
they are described about the middle of the sixteenth century, in the survey
made by Clarkson for the seventh earl, “without feeling that he had seen the
martial, social, and most knightly centre of mediæval life in Northumberland.”
And so also, in like manner, no one now can visit Alnwick Castle, and not
feel deeply impressed with the conviction that the England, of which the
past history possesses monumental records and still living witnesses such as
this, is a land rich as well in the most precious elements of present strength
as in the most glorious of memories; and so, when her true sons look forward
to the future of England, they may do so in the spirit of the fine old motto
of the Percies&mdash;ESPERANCE.</p>

<p class="p2">The annals of the truly noble family of the
Percies, as we have seen, down to the death of
Josceline, the eleventh earl, in 1670, extend over
five centuries, during three hundred and sixty-one
years of which period, almost without interruption,
the family was intimately connected with Alnwick.
By the limitation of the patent of 1557, the youthful
daughter of Earl Josceline was incapable of inheriting
her father’s honours, and thus, at last, the Percies’
earldom again became extinct, when no inconsiderable
part of their immense possessions lapsed to the
crown: the great northern earldom, however, was
not permitted in this manner to pass away without
more than one fruitless effort on the part of collateral
descendants to establish a claim to the succession.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the alienation of some of the
estates consequent upon the extinction of the Earldom
of Northumberland, Elizabeth Percy, the daughter of the last earl, was
the most wealthy heiress in the realm; and, accordingly, it was considered
to be a matter of the greatest importance that a suitable alliance should be
arranged for her with the least possible delay. When but little more than
a child, in 1679, she was married to Henry Cavendish, Earl of Ogle, and
heir to the Duke of Newcastle, who died in the following year. Before
another year had expired, the youthful widow was again married to Thomas
Thynn of Longleat; but once more the heiress became a widow very shortly
after her marriage. Her second husband was murdered early in 1682, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he was passing in his coach along Pall Mall. While she was still not more
than fifteen years of age, within three months after the tragedy in Pall Mall,
Elizabeth Percy became the wife of Charles Seymour, sixth Duke of Somerset,
by whom only she had issue: she died in 1722, leaving, besides three daughters,
one only surviving son, Algernon, who in 1748 succeeded his father as seventh
Duke of Somerset. In 1749 this duke was created Baron of Warkworth and
Earl of Northumberland, with remainder of those dignities to the heirs male
of his daughter, his only surviving child, by her marriage with Sir Hugh
Smithson. The duke died in 1750, when the Seymour dignities reverted to
the male descendants of the Protector Somerset by his first marriage. Thus,
once more, an only daughter, now bearing the paternal name of Seymour,
was the heiress and representative of the Percy lords of Alnwick: and thus,
by reason of his alliance with this lady, Sir Hugh Smithson became <i>jure uxoris</i>,
by special Act of Parliament, Earl of Northumberland; and he himself, his
countess, and their descendants, were empowered and authorised to take and
use the surname of Percy alone, and to bear and quarter all the armorial
insignia of that noble house.</p>

<p>The fortunate husband of this last heiress of the Percies, on the death of
his grandfather, Sir Hugh Smithson, in the year 1729, succeeded to the
baronetcy, which had been conferred by Charles II. in 1663 on that grandfather’s
grandfather, also a Hugh Smithson. A remarkably handsome man,
with a refined taste, and in many other respects well qualified for the distinguished
destiny which awaited him, Sir Hugh Smithson is said to have been
in no slight degree indebted for his eventual splendid matrimonial success to
a previous failure. He had attracted the attention of Lady Percy, who, on
hearing that some other lady had rejected the suit of Sir Hugh Smithson,
expressed her surprise that any lady should have refused to accept such a
man. The words of the fair and noble heiress reached the ears of the disconsolate
baronet, and they promptly wrought a marvellous change in his
views and aspirations. Upon the hint so given Sir Hugh spoke, and&mdash;his
words were not in vain. In nearly all the “Peerages,” borrowed one from
another, it is stated that this Sir Hugh Smithson early in life went to London,
where he established himself in business as an apothecary. Although no
slur would thus have been cast on the illustrious race, it is simply untrue.
The following statement, extracted from a “Baronetage” published in 1727,
may be accepted in proof:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The present Sir Hugh Smithson married a sister of the late Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Langdale, and had two sons, who lived to man’s estate. Hugh, the eldest,
died unmarried before his father; Langdale Smithson, the second son,
married Miss Revely, by whom he left only one son, Hugh&mdash;now a minor,
and a most hopeful young gentleman&mdash;so that there now remain only two
heirs to the title and estate&mdash;this young gentleman, Sir Hugh’s grandson, and
Hugh Smithson, of Tottenham, Esq., cousin of Sir Hugh.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The East Garret.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The “young gentleman” in question succeeded his grandfather as Sir
Hugh Smithson, of Stanwick. There was no trace in any documents or
papers of his ever having been in any position but that of the acknowledged
heir to a considerable estate and to a baronetage, granted to his ancestor for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
his loyalty and sacrifices in the royal cause during the civil wars of Charles I.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
He married Lady Percy on the 16th of July, 1740, when he became Earl of
Northumberland with all the territorial greatness attendant on that earldom.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1766 the earl was created Duke of Northumberland and Earl Percy, with
succession to his heirs male; and, finally, in 1784, the barony of Lovaine was
added to the duke’s accumulated dignities, with remainder to the younger of
his two sons. The duchess died in 1776, but the duke survived till 1786:
they had one daughter, who died unmarried, and two sons, Hugh and
Algernon, of whom the elder succeeded his father as second Duke of Northumberland,
a distinguished general officer in the first American War. The second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
duke married, first, a daughter of the then Earl of Bute; and, secondly,
Frances Julia, third daughter of Peter Burrell, Esquire, a Commissioner of the
Excise, by whom he had a numerous family: the duke died in 1817, and was
succeeded by Hugh, his eldest son, who thus became the third Duke of
Northumberland, the princely representative of George IV. at the coronation
of Charles X. of France. This third duke died, without issue, in 1847, having
married Lady Charlotte Florentia Clive, youngest daughter of Earl Powis:
and thus the dukedom passed to the third duke’s brother, the younger son of
the second duke, who at the time of his brother’s death bore the title of
Baron Prudhoe&mdash;an independent peerage to which he himself had been
elevated in 1816, in consideration of his services as an officer in the navy.</p>

<p>Algernon Percy, fourth Duke of Northumberland, was born in 1792; in
1842 he married the Lady Eleanor Grosvenor, daughter of the Marquis of
Westminster; in 1847 he succeeded to the honours and possessions of his
family; he was created a K.G. in 1852, when he also held the office of First
Lord of the Admiralty; and on February 12th, 1865, he died at Alnwick
Castle, and, as his brother and predecessor had died, without any issue.
Like the great soldier, with whose memory the dukedom of Wellington must
ever be directly associated, Sir Algernon Percy will long be remembered with
affectionate and grateful admiration as <span class="smcap">The</span> Duke of Northumberland. A true
English sailor, a princely English Nobleman, an elegant scholar and an accomplished
gentleman, large of heart too and open of hand, with his commanding
presence Duke Algernon looked every inch a Percy; and, in very deed, in
his person were centred the brightest of the brilliant qualities of his forefathers,
in happy combination with those admirable endowments that were
peculiarly his own.</p>

<p>The two sons of the first duke (as we have seen) bore the same names as
the two sons of his successor the second duke&mdash;Hugh and Algernon Percy.
The two brothers, the sons of the first duke, married two sisters, daughters of
Mr. Burrell.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> With Duke Algernon the line of Hugh, the elder of the sons
of the first duke, became extinct; and, consequently, the succession to the
dukedom passed to the descendants of that other Algernon who was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
younger son of the first duke. This Algernon, who on the death of his
father became Baron Lovaine, in 1798 was created Earl of Beverley: he died
in 1830. George Percy, his son, then succeeded as Earl of Beverley; and
subsequently, in 1865, at that time being in the 87th year of his age, this
venerable nobleman became the fifth Duke of Northumberland. He died
August 21, 1867; and was succeeded by his eldest surviving son (by his
marriage with Louisa, daughter of the Hon. A. Stuart Wortley). The present
peer, Algernon George Percy, sixth Duke and eighteenth Earl of Northumberland,
Earl Percy, Earl of Beverley, Baron Warkworth, Baron Lovaine of
Alnwick, and a baronet, was born May 2nd, 1810, and was educated at Eton.
He entered the army in 1827, and retired in 1836. In 1858 he was a Lord
of the Admiralty, in 1859 Vice-President of the Board of Trade, and from
1831 to 1865 sat in Parliament, first for Beeralston and afterwards for North
Northumberland. He is Colonel of the Northumberland Militia, Hon. Colonel
of the Percy Northumberland Volunteer Artillery, and President of the
National Lifeboat Institution. In 1845 his grace married Louisa, daughter
of the late Henry Drummond, Esq., M.P., of Abury Park, Surrey, by whom
he has issue living two sons, viz., Henry George Percy, Earl of Percy,
married, in 1868, to Lady Edith Campbell, eldest daughter of the Duke of
Argyll, by whom he has issue; and Lord Algernon Malcolm Arthur Percy.
His grace is patron of twenty-two livings, nineteen of which are in Northumberland
and one each in Yorkshire, Dorsetshire, and Surrey.</p>

<p>The arms of the Duke of Northumberland are: Quarterly, 1st and 4th
Lovaine and Lucy quarterly (viz., 1st and 4th, <i>or</i>, a lion rampant, <i>azure</i>,
for Lovaine, 2nd and 3rd, <i>gules</i>, three luces or pikes, hauriant, for Lucy),
2nd and 3rd, <i>azure</i>, five lozenges conjoined in fesse, <i>or</i>, for Percy. Crest:
On a chapeau, <i>gules</i>, turned up, <i>ermine</i>, a lion statant, tail extended, <i>azure</i>.
Supporters: Dexter, a lion, <i>azure</i>; sinister, a lion, guardant, <i>or</i>, gorged with
a collar compony, <i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>.</p>

<p>His grace’s other seats are, Keilder, Prudhoe, and Warkworth castles, in
Northumberland; Sion House, Middlesex; Stanwick Park, Yorkshire; Albury
Park; and Northumberland House, Charing Cross.</p>

<p>Thus having brought down our sketch of the lords of Alnwick, from the
early days in English history that immediately followed the Norman Conquest to
the times now present, we return to their noble castle on the banks of the Aln.</p>

<p>Within a few years of the Conquest, the Normans erected in various parts
of England important edifices, both military and ecclesiastical, in truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
astonishing numbers: and of these, in addition to the cathedrals and the
greater churches, there still exist many noble castellated relics, some of them
in a proximate degree retaining the leading features of their original arrangement,
form, and appearance. At the same time, even in the case of the
most perfect of the existing castles, many changes of grave importance have
been introduced as century has succeeded to century; so that now, whenever
any one early castle is examined with a view to trace out and to determine
both what it was at the first, and in what order and with what motives certain
palpable alterations and innovations have followed one another, it always is
highly satisfactory to feel that an unquestionable general uniformity of plan
and arrangement in all the early castles enables each one of them that is still
in being, in some degree at any rate, to illustrate and explain every other.
As a matter of course, whenever the architectural features in any old castle
are original, the great art of the architect is able, unaided and beyond all
controversy, to tell its own historical tale: but, genuine original architectural
features are not always available to give their conclusive evidence; and, but
too frequently, without some external aid, it is not possible to follow the
career of the two terrible adversaries of early edifices (and particularly those
of the noblest rank), demolition and restoration&mdash;demolition, either wilful or
the result of accident and chance; and restoration, which always is wilful,
though happily not always equally destructive.</p>

<p>As it now stands, in every quality of high merit <span class="smcap">Alnwick Castle</span> certainly
yields to no other restored edifice of a similar rank. Of the castle of to-day
it may truthfully be affirmed that, with a close approach to an exact fidelity,
in its prevailing external arrangements and its general features it represents
the grand old fortress of times long passed away. Time had dealt somewhat
hardly with the Percy stronghold, and injudicious attempts to make good the
ravages of the destroyer had aggravated the evil, when the recent great work
of restoration was taken in hand. Then every vestige of the old structure
was diligently and carefully examined, and every available early document
was critically studied; the remains also of other castles then were investigated,
and all that they could suggest was applied by the restorers of Alnwick to
the furtherance of their great project. Hence the plan of Alnwick, as we
now have it, while it can scarcely claim to be absolutely identical with the
original plan, may be accepted as not greatly differing from it in any essential
particulars. Whether Yvo de Vesci, the undoubted founder of the castle,
was enabled fully to carry out his own original plans, we are not able at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
present time accurately to determine; but, still it may be assumed that the
plans of De Vesci, to whatever degree they may have been realised by himself,
both in extent and in general configuration closely resembled those which
were worked out by the Percies, when they had become lords Alnwick, as
these, in their turn, were afterwards followed as their guides by the recent
restorers who were employed by Duke Algernon.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Bond Gate: “Hotspur’s Gate.”</i></p>
</div>

<p>The great epochs in the architectural history of Alnwick Castle may be
thus distinguished.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">De Vesci</span>, about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1150: the original founding of the castle, and its
erection as an Anglo-Norman stronghold.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">First Percy</span>, from 1309 to 1315: the second founding and great
reparation of the castle, with either the complete rebuilding or the original
erection of many of its most important parts. At this period were erected
the Barbican, the Gate-House, the Western Garret; the Abbot’s, Falconer’s,
Armourer’s, Constable’s, and Auditor’s Towers; also the Postern and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Ravine Towers, the Gateway between the first and second baly, with the
adjoining curtain-walls both east and west, a great portion of the east side of
the Keep, the Well, and the grand Baronial Hall.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Second Percy</span>, from 1315 to 1352; the completion of portions of the
works of the preceding period, and the erection of the two flanking towers
(No. 8 in plan) in advance of the Norman entrance to the Keep: these towers
are represented in our engraving.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">Third Percy</span>, ending in 1455: various important reparations and
additions, most of the latter having been removed by the first duke in the
next period.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">First Duke of Northumberland</span>, from 1750 to 1786: general reparation,
after a long period of neglect and ruin, including a material transformation
of the greater part of the castle. The Keep was almost entirely demolished,
and rebuilt after the manner that was called (and, in one sense of that term,
really was) “Gothic” in the eighteenth century in England; and the towers
and curtain of the circumvallation suffered in like manner.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="smcap">Fourth Duke of Northumberland</span>, from 1854 to 1865: complete
restoration of the entire castle. The important works erected by Duke
Algernon along the lines of the circumvallation, and to the south and the
south-west of these lines, have already been described; in addition to these,
the duke rebuilt the range of apartments extending from the Keep southwards
to the Edwardian Gateway from the first to the second baly; and he built
the noble Prudhoe Tower, with the chapel adjoining it, the Ante-Room, the
Guard Chamber, the present Dining-Hall, and the completion of the Keep.</p>

<p>The governing idea of this restoration was <i>really to restore</i>, in all their
leading and most characteristic features, the mediæval arrangements and
aspect of Alnwick Castle so far as its exterior was concerned; while, at the
same time, the whole of the interior of the restored edifice was to be planned,
fitted, and adorned, in the most sumptuous style, after the manner of a cinquecento
Roman palace, and with all the luxurious splendour and the various
skilful contrivances required and suggested by the taste and the usages of
the present day. The only important deviation from the former part of the
duke’s plan, was the removal of the Edwardian Towers, and the adjoining
curtain-wall between the Abbot’s Tower and the Postern Tower, in order to
open the view from the windows of the new Prudhoe Tower towards the
north: but the Italian portion of the scheme was accomplished in its integrity.
The whole of the architectural restoration and rebuilding was carried out with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the most perfect success, under the direction of Mr. Salvin, an architect
eminently distinguished for his practical knowledge of the Early Gothic of
England in its military aspect, as also for both the conscientious fidelity of his
restorations and the judicious consistency of his original designs. We can
easily understand with what satisfaction Mr. Salvin must have removed the
Strawberry Hill pseudo-Gothic of the first duke, as well as the far higher
gratification which must have attended the progressive realisation of his own
truly admirable compositions.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-105.jpg" width="400" height="397" id="a105"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>Alnwick Abbey.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The project for causing the thoroughly English mediæval military-Gothic
casket of Mr. Salvin to enclose contents that should be in every respect the
very reverse of what is either English or mediæval or military or Gothic, was
discussed and finally adopted at a congress held in the castle under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
presidency of Algernon, Duke of Northumberland, and attended by the English
professors of classic architecture, Cockerell and Donaldson; the Roman antiquary,
the Commendatore Canina; and the Italian architect, Signor Montiroli.
It is to be regretted that such masters of Gothic Art as Scott, Waterhouse,
Street, and Burges had not also been present, who might have saved
the Border Castle of the Percies from the magnificent anomaly of being
externally English and internally Roman. The execution of the whole of the
interior can be described only in terms of the highest commendation; and it
is especially satisfactory to know that the profusion of carved work in an
Italian style which was required for the various purposes of decoration, and
which has been pronounced to be “a marvel of delicacy and finish,” was
produced under the direction of Signor Bulletti of Florence, by a staff of
English and Scottish carvers, who worked for several years in a studio
established for that particular purpose in the castle. There also was a
second studio, in which the more important of the decorations in plaster were
modelled and cast. It is scarcely necessary to add that in all the minor
details of furnishing, the grand original plan has been fully and faithfully
carried into effect. While we cordially recognise as well the enlarged views
and the princely munificence of the duke himself, as the skill, the taste, and
the ability of every individual who took part in his great work of restoration,
it is impossible not to regret that so glorious an opportunity for vindicating
the versatile and comprehensive powers of true Gothic art should have been
permitted to pass away. There can be no question as to the capacity of the
same great style to have rendered the interior of Alnwick Castle a type of
splendid, and yet agreeable, magnificence, which on the exterior has displayed
its structural resources in a manner at once so noble and so consistent. But,
as this was not to be, we rejoice in knowing that what has been done
within the Percy walls has been done so well; and our gratification is the
more sincere and the more hearty, because at every point the Percy walls
themselves, true to their grand traditions, wear such an aspect as Hotspur
might have recognised with an approving smile, and the old Earls of Northumberland
would have been proud to accept as becoming their northern home.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>And here we resume our survey of the castle, setting forth towards the
Keep from within the Gate-House, which is itself situated within the
Barbican. We proceed eastwards to the gateway (No. 2 in plan), which
admits us to the second or inner baly. From this we approach the
entrance to the Keep, and pass between the Edwardian flanking towers
with their octagonal fronts (No. 3 in the plan): thus we reach the grand old
Norman arch, De Vesci’s work, massive and deeply recessed, rich with zig-zags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and bands of sharp indentations, which forms the main entrance to the
innermost court or ward of the Keep itself. Immediately adjoining the
Norman archway is the draw-well constructed by the first Percy. Now we
have before us the new Corridor, carried round a part of the court on piers
and corbels. We pass the inner porches, and the entrance-halls, and reach
the Grand Staircase (No. 5 in plan), worthily so called, and we find that we
have entered such a palace as might overlook, not the Aln, but the Tiber.
At the head of the noble flight of steps, each one of them a single block of
white Rothbury stone, twelve feet in length, is the Guard-Chamber, with its
floor of rich Venetian mosaic, its panelled ceiling, and the deep frieze
reflecting the memories of Chevy Chase. Corridors lead to both the right
hand and the left from the Guard-Room; and it also gives access to a
gorgeous Ante-Room, placed between the great Library, 54 feet long, which
occupies the entire range of the Prudhoe Tower, and follows its contour;
and the Saloon, another magnificent apartment, in length 42 feet with a bay
formed by a circular tower. Next succeeds the State Drawing-Room, of
irregular form, its largest measurements being 46 by 34 feet. Then we
enter the grand Dining-Hall, 60 feet long, and in both width and height
24 feet, which covers the site of the old baronial hall of the early Percies.
The Breakfast-Room adjoins this most princely hall, and, passing it, the
Corridor leads us in succession to the State Bed-Rooms and Dressing-Rooms,
and to the private apartments of the duke and duchess, together with other
staircases. Thus, on the principal floor there are two staircases besides the
grand staircase, and eighteen chambers, exclusive of the chapel. The Chapel
(No. 12 in plan), of which we give a view from the outer baly, is a building
of great beauty and interest, having a stone-vaulted ceiling within a roof of
a high pitch, a semi-octagonal apsidal end towards the south-west, and lancet
windows: its total length is 46 feet, and in the interior it is enriched with
Italian mosaic, after the manner of the Henry III. work in the Confessor’s
Chapel in Westminster Abbey. We must be content, in a single brief
sentence (the space at our disposal restricts us absolutely to one such
sentence), to state concerning every apartment in the grand range of the
entire circuit of the Keep, and also in the southern wing, which extends to the
Percy gateway, that the most gorgeous Art of the Italian <i>Renaissance</i>, with
all its manifold resources, has been taxed to the utmost in order to produce a
palace of the highest rank, pervaded throughout with harmonious, yet ever-varied,
magnificence.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Hulne Abbey: The Percy Tower.</i></p>
</div>

<p>On the ground-floor, which is on the same level with the entrance-hall,
are the various apartments, consistently grouped and classified, required by
the principal domestics of the household, together with the wine-cellars,
pantries, and such other chambers and appliances as would be necessary to
complete this department of the ducal establishment. Once more we return
to the Prudhoe Tower, and ascend above its two upper floors of bed and
dressing-rooms, to the Banner-turret, which rises to the height of two
additional floors; and here, having gained the leads, standing beneath the proud
insignia of the Percies, heavily blazoned upon their broad silken banner, we
lean over the embattled parapet, and look down upon the Keep, and around
upon the cordon of towers and walls, and the fair domains and the silvery
river beyond, and so we bid farewell to the lordly castle of Alnwick.</p>

<p>Until the middle of the fifteenth century was near at hand the town of
Alnwick remained unprotected by a wall, and open consequently to all perils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
incidental to its position on the Border. About the year 1433, however, the
good town was fortified with walls, and the four entrances were defended
each by its own strong tower-guarded gateway. One only of these early
gateways still remains in a fair condition of preservation; this, the Bond
Gate, sometimes (but without any other reason than a lingering delight to
associate any fine old relic at Alnwick with that name) is called “Hotspur’s
Gate.” It bears a badge of the second Percy lord of Alnwick, and in all
probability was erected by him; its outer face is represented in the engraving.</p>

<p>The other gateways have disappeared;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and from the time that border-strife
passed into the domain of history, the walls of Alnwick gradually ceased
to exist, until now traces only of their former existence, and of these “few
and far between,” remain to attest the record of their having ever existed.
Devoutly it is to be hoped that the one relic of the town of the olden time,
the Bond Gate, will be cherished, simply because it is such a relic&mdash;because
it links the town to the castle, and the castle to the town, with the strong
tie of historical association. Again space, or rather the want of it, constrains
us to leave unnoticed the fine church of St. Michael, the church of St. Paul,
founded and erected by Duke Hugh, and the other public buildings in
Alnwick; and, with them, the privileges, usages, and the entire local history
of the town.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Of the remains of the early edifices, both ecclesiastical and castellated,
which are closely associated with Alnwick Castle, all of them of great
interest, and all of them also no less worthy of detailed description than of
careful examination, we must be content briefly to notice two&mdash;Alnwick
Abbey, and Hulne, or Holn, Priory.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Hulne Abbey: The Church.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Built to the north of the Aln, at an easy distance from the castle, upon a
rich soil and in a scene of sequestered beauty, Alnwick Abbey, founded in
1147 by Eustace de Vesci for Premonstratensian Canons, was richly endowed
by the founder and also by his successor. The Percies, in like manner, were
in every respect as munificent as the earlier benefactors of the abbey, so that
it long occupied an honourable position among the religious establishments
of the country. The canons of Alnwick, however, did not rise to distinction
in consequence of any eminent attainments; but, on the other hand, while
in earlier times they were somewhat notorious for a turbulent spirit, the
report on their abbey made to Henry VIII. contains a truly deplorable
record of the degrading superstitions by means of which, in common with
but too many of their brethren, the monks imposed on the people, and sometimes
even succeeded in deceiving themselves. Of the buildings of the
abbey, which, without doubt, were worthy to take rank with those of the
castle, the sole relic that is still in existence is a turreted and embattled
gateway, a structure not earlier than the middle of the fifteenth century.
The eastern face of this gateway displays the quartered arms of Percy and
Lucy; on the other faces are the insignia of De Vesci. The other buildings
have altogether disappeared, except here and there some sculptured stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
which have found their way into the walls of houses constructed by modern
masons. The site of the abbey, with the Northumberland estates once
annexed to it, after various vicissitudes, has become the property of the
Dukes of Northumberland.</p>

<p>Distant from Alnwick Abbey about two miles along the northern bank of
the Aln, and like the abbey placed in the midst of the most lovely scenery,
the Priory of <span class="smcap">Hulne</span>, or <span class="smcap">Holn</span>, has so far been more fortunate than its more
dignified neighbour, that it yet possesses considerable remains of its original
buildings in a condition of picturesque ruin. A lofty wall still encircles the
entire area of the priory&mdash;a feature sufficiently significant of the lawless
character of early Border-life, and of the stern necessity which constrained
even a religious community to rely for security upon the strength of its
fortifications. In our engraving we show the present aspect of the tower,
built, as will be seen, with massive solidity, by Henry de Percy, fourth Earl
of Northumberland, in the year 1488; and in another engraving, we give
a general view of the ruins of the church, as they are seen from the north-east.
It is pleasant to be able to add that the remains of Hulne Priory are
carefully preserved and freely shown. The brethren, who for more than
three centuries found a secure dwelling-place surrounded with the most
beautiful scenery, were Carmelite or White Friars; and a romantic story (of
which several versions are in existence) is told concerning their order in
connection with the foundation of this priory. The site of the priory was
given by the second William de Vesci about 1240; but the chief endowment
came, between 1252 and 1289, from John de Vesci; the house itself,
however, appears to have been erected by Ralph Fulborne, a wealthy landholder
of Northumberland, who lived in the stirring times when the lords of
broad and fertile acres went armed to fight in the Holy Land against the
infidels.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In after times the Percies confirmed the grants of the earlier
benefactors of Hulne, and made to them some slight additions. The
Carmelites of Hulne were men who, according to the light of their times,
cultivated learning; this is shown by the still existing catalogue of the
numerous manuscripts that once formed their library. There has also been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
preserved another equally curious and interesting document, formerly the
property of these Carmelite brethren; it is an inventory of their vestments
and of the fittings of their church, which must have been very costly as well
as numerous and splendid. Inventories and catalogues such as these possess
a peculiar value, as illustrations of the intellectual pursuits and character of
the monastic age, and also in consequence of the light they throw upon
the sentiments and usages that then were prevalent in our country.</p>

<p>Descending from the secluded hill-side where the ruins of Hulne Priory
nestle amidst the thick woods, and crossing both the vale below, and the
river beyond it, a roadway leads to the beautiful pleasure-grounds of Hulne
Park. Here on one of the highest of the many elevated points, and rising
above the surrounding trees, is the Tower on the Hill, or Brislee Tower,
erected by the first duke in 1781. This structure is a characteristic specimen
of the <i>Gothesque</i> architecture, of which so much was happily removed
during the recent restorations, from Alnwick Castle. From the upper balcony
of this tower, at a height of about 70 feet from the ground, the view is
singularly fine, and in its extent truly extraordinary. At different points of
the compass, and at varying distances, this panoramic view comprehends the
vale of Whittingham and the windings of the Aln; the range of the Cheviots,
with a glimpse of the hills of Teviotdale forty miles away; the memorable
high land of Flodden may also be distinguished; and, towards the sea, are
the castles of Warkworth, Bambro’, and Dunstanburgh; and beyond them,
in a fringe-like line, lies the sea itself.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the hospitality for which the lords of Alnwick
have been renowned since the first stone of the castle was laid is still
maintained within its princely walls; its list of “visitors” during many
centuries past has contained the names of those who were not only the
loftiest in rank but the most eminent in Art, Science, and Letters.</p>

<p>Its park and grounds are among the most perfect in the kingdom;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
successive lords have laboured to make them beautiful, and Nature had given
auspicious ground on which to work&mdash;hill and dell alternate; a lovely and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
rapid, though narrow, river runs through them; on either side are green
banks, in many places overhung by the rich foliage of varied trees; here and
there views are obtained of the distant hills&mdash;the Cheviots&mdash;with their
thousand traditions of times happily gone by, but which excite interest by
their associations with heroic deeds&mdash;and not unfrequently their “opposites”&mdash;of
which every spot is fertile on the border that separates Scotland from
England.</p>

<p>Happily, there is now no sensation of jealousy or envy, nothing that can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
either humiliate or exasperate, when the Scottishman boasts of triumphs
over his southern neighbours; nor when he admits that, often, before
the bold men of Northumberland he shrunk back in mortal dread. The
glories of the one have long ceased to be the degradations of the other;
and the spirit of rivalry is only that which has for its aim and object the
supremacy of the country of both. Will the happy time ever arrive when the
three kingdoms shall be as essentially one as the two have been for
centuries past?</p>

</div>
<p class="dc13">HARDWICK HALL may take rank among the
more stately of the “homes of England.”
Stately in its outer aspect, stately in its
antique furniture and its interior fittings and appointments,
and truly stately in its associations,
it is one of the most historically interesting, and
one of the most singular and picturesque, of the
many “homes” whose countless stores of natural
beauties and acquired treasures are, through the
kindness and liberality of their owners, made accessible
alike to peer and peasant; while it is one of the
fullest in its historical associations, and in its power of
carrying the mind of the visitor back through a long
vista of years to those stirring times when “Good Queen
Bess,” the strong-minded and strong-headed “master” of
its noble owner, sate on the throne of England. Hardwick
and its surroundings belong essentially to those times, and to
the people who moved prominently in them: the very furniture we
see to-day pertains to that eventful era&mdash;for not only is the building
itself of the period to which we refer, but so are even the “fittings;”
the beds&mdash;for here is the very bed used by Mary, Queen of Scots,
and covered with needlework, the work of her own fair hands; the
tables around and at which sate “Bess of Hardwick” with her historic family
and brilliant friends; the tapestry is that which then hung around them, and
on which the eyes of royalty and nobility have rested and “feasted with
admiration;” the screens, the chairs, the couches,&mdash;nay, almost all the objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
that meet the eye are of those stirring times, and have about them an historic
air which seems irresistibly to subdue the mind and to expand the thoughts of
the visitor.</p>

<p>Even a <i>glance</i> at the graces and beauties of Derbyshire would demand far
greater space than we can accord to them: for it is the shire of all the English
shires in which natural beauties are most happily combined with cultivated
graces; hill and dale alternate at every mile; rich valleys, through which run
fertilising rivers, shut in by mountain rocks, tree-clad from base to summit;
singular peaks, that seem as if not formed by Nature, but the work of giant
hands; delicious dells, where rivulets sing perpetually, and myriad birds
rejoice in spring or summer. Other counties may be more sublimely grand,
and others more abundantly fertile, but there is none so truly rich in the
picturesque; whether of distant views or of by-paths up hill-sides, or through
lanes clothed in perpetual verdure.</p>

<p>And then its history, a page of which may be read at every turn&mdash;the Celt,
the Roman, the Saxon, the Dane, the Norman, all the “peoples and nations”
that have made Britain their home, have left in this shire enduring evidence of
possession and progress; and many of its customs remain unchanged, not only
since the beacons were lit on Blakelow or on Bruncliffe, but since the Baal fires
were burning on Axe-Edge or Chelmorton.</p>

<p>Proofs of a milder occupancy, too, are to be found in abundance. Nowhere
are peaceful “Halls” more numerous&mdash;remains of prosperous epochs: Haddon,
of an early date; Wingfield and Hardwick, of a later period; Chatsworth, of
a time comparatively recent; and Kedleston, of an age scarce removed from
living memory,&mdash;are but a few of the many that glorify this beautiful shire.
No wonder, therefore, that it is the county of all others to which the tourist is
most frequently attracted.</p>

<p>Surrounded on all sides by charming scenery, and the richest and most
abundant land, Hardwick stands in all its majesty and grace, and forms&mdash;both
in the distance, when a first glimpse of its bold outline is gained from Brackenfield
or other heights, or when viewed from nearer points&mdash;a striking feature
in the landscape. When approached from one of the great centres for Derbyshire
tourists, Matlock, the drive is of peculiar interest, and may be, with profit
to the future visitor, briefly described. Leaving Matlock by way of Matlock
Bridge, the road passes through what is called Matlock Town, whose picturesque
church is seen overtopping the rocks to the right, where the graceful
bend of the river Derwent adds its beauties to the scene; thence passing along
the roadway, Riber&mdash;an immense and very steep hill&mdash;rises to the right, and
will be noticed as surmounted by the massive modern erection of Riber Castle,
the residence of Mr. Smedley, the hydropathist.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Hardwick Hall, with the Entrance Gateway.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The road continues by
Tansley, with its church, its mills, and its pretty dales; Tansley, or Dethick,
Moor, a wild unreclaimed tract of moorland, purple with heather and untrammelled
with fences; Washington, with its village-green, its stocks, and its
duck-ponds; Higham, a picturesque village with an ancient cross; Shirland,
with its fine monuments, some of which are of remarkable character and full of
interest; Morton, with its pretty church and charming cottages; for a short
distance the coal district, with their pits and shafts and ever-creaking engines;
Pilsley and its pleasant lanes; Hardstoft and Deeplane, to the lower entrance
to the Park: through these and other places of deep and varied interest we go,
until we reach the Hardwick Inn&mdash;a pretty house of entertainment close to the
entrance to the Park, from which a winding ascent of less than a mile leads to
the Hall. By this route some curious transitions from the lead-mining district
to that of coal, and from the limestone to the sandstone, with their varied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
scenery and their diversified aspects, will be noticed; and Derbyshire, rich
both in minerals beneath the surface and in arable, meadow, and pasture land
on its face, as well as in rock, and tree, and wood, and hill, will be seen to
great advantage. From Chesterfield, too, the road is beautiful; and the visitor
may make a delightful “day’s round” by driving direct to Hardwick by way
of Temple Normanton; Heath, with its truly picturesque and interesting
church and parsonage; Ault Hucknall, in the church of which are many
monuments of the Cavendish family, and where lies buried that sometime
“world’s wonder,” “Hobbes of Malmesbury;” thence through the lodge-gates
and down the fine old deer-park to the Hall, and then returning by way of
Bolsover Castle, a magnificent old building, the former residence of the
Cavendishes, Earls and Dukes of Newcastle, and rendered famous in the Duke
of Newcastle’s work on horsemanship, 1658, and now for many years the residence
of Mrs. Hamilton Gray, the authoress of “Etruria.” But from whatever
side Hardwick is approached, the land is full of beauty, and rich in the
picturesque.</p>

<p>Hardwick Hall is one of the many princely seats&mdash;Chatsworth, Bolton
Abbey, Lismore Castle, Holker Hall, Compton Place, Eastbourne, and Devonshire
House, London, being among the others&mdash;of his Grace the Duke of
Devonshire, in which resides the duke’s eldest son and heir, the Marquis of
Hartington, M.P., at this time Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Ireland.
It is distant from London about 140 miles, from Derby 20 miles, from Chesterfield
9, and from Matlock 15 miles, and these are perhaps the more general
routes by which visitors will proceed. Whatever road is taken, they will find
natural beauties in abundance greeting the eye at every mile of a delicious
journey.</p>

<p>Before we describe the venerable Hall, we give a brief history of the noble
family to which it now belongs, reserving that of its predecessors for a later
page.</p>

<p>The family of Cavendish, of which his Grace the present Duke of Devonshire,
K.G., Lord Lieutenant of the county of Derby, is the representative,
traces back to the Conquest, when Robert de Gernon came over with the
Conqueror, and so distinguished himself in arms that he was rewarded with
considerable grants of land in Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, &amp;c. His
descendants held considerable land in Derbyshire; and Sir William Gernon,
who was one of the witnesses to a confirmation charter of Henry III. to
Basingdale Priory, obtained a grant of a fair at Bakewell, in that county. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
had two sons, Sir Ralph de Gernon, lord of Bakewell, and Geoffrey de Gernon,
of Moor Hall, near Bakewell. From the second of these, Geoffrey de Gernon,
the Cavendishes are descended. His son, Roger de Gernon (who died 1334),
married the heiress of John Potton, or Potkins, Lord of the Manor of Cavendish,
in Suffolk, and by her had issue, four sons, who all assumed the name of
Cavendish from their mother’s manor. These were Sir John Cavendish, Chief
Justice of the King’s Bench, in the time of Edward III., Chancellor of
Cambridge, 4th of Richard II.; he was beheaded by the insurgents of Suffolk
in that reign; Roger Cavendish, from whom descended the celebrated navigator,
Sir Thomas Cavendish; Stephen Cavendish, Lord Mayor, member of
Parliament, and Sheriff of London; and Richard Cavendish. Sir John married
Alice, daughter of Sir John Odyngseles, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, who
brought to her husband the manor of Cavendish Overhall, and by her, who
died before him, had issue, two sons, Andrew and John, and a daughter, Alice,
married to William Nell. Sir Andrew Cavendish, the eldest son, was Sheriff
of Norfolk and Suffolk. By his wife, Rose, he left issue, one son, William,
from whom the estates passed to his cousin. Sir Andrew was succeeded by
his brother, Sir John Cavendish, Esquire of the Body to Richard II. and
Henry V., who, for his gallant conduct in killing the rebel, Wat Tyler, in his
conflict with Sir William Walworth, was knighted by Richard II. in Smithfield,
and an annuity of £40 per annum granted to him and his sons for ever. He
was also made broiderer of the wardrobe to the king. He married Joan,
daughter of Sir William Clopton, of Clopton, in Suffolk; and by her had issue,
three sons, William, his successor; Robert, Serjeant-at-Law; and Walter.
William Cavendish, who was a citizen and mercer of London, and of Cavendish
Overhall, married Joan Staventon, by whom he had two sons, Thomas and
William. This Thomas Cavendish, who was of Cavendish and Pollingford, in
Suffolk, married Katherine Scudamore, and left by her, as son and heir, Sir
Thomas Cavendish, who, having studied the law, was employed by Thomas,
Earl of Surrey, Treasurer of the King’s Exchequer. He was also Clerk of the
Pipe in the Exchequer to Henry VIII.&mdash;the office of the Clerk of the Pipe being
to make out leases of Crown lands, accounts of the sheriffs, &amp;c. He married
twice, and left, by his first wife, Alice, daughter and co-heir of John Smith, of
Podbrooke Hall, besides other issue, three sons, George Cavendish, Sir
William Cavendish, and Sir Thomas Cavendish.</p>

<p>George Cavendish, the eldest of these three sons, was of Glemsford, and
Cavendish Overhall, and is said to have been the author of “Cavendish’s Life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of Wolsey,” although the authorship of that work is also attributed to his
brother Sir William Cavendish. He received a liberal education, and was
endowed by his father with considerable landed property in Suffolk. His
character and learning seem to have recommended him to the special notice of
Cardinal Wolsey, who “took him to be about his own person, as gentleman
usher of his chamber, and placed a special confidence in him.” George
Cavendish was succeeded by his son William; the latter was succeeded by his
son William, who passed away the manor of Cavendish Overhall to William
Downes.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Cavendish was one of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, and
died unmarried.</p>

<p>Sir William Cavendish, the second son of the first Sir Thomas, became the
founder of several noble families. He was married three times: first to a
daughter of Edward Bostock, of Whatcross in Cheshire; secondly, to a
daughter of Sir Thomas Conyngsby, and widow of William Paris; and thirdly,
to Elizabeth, daughter of John Hardwick, of Hardwick, and widow of Robert
Barley, of Barley. He was “a man of learning and business,” and was much
employed in important affairs by his sovereigns; filling the posts of Treasurer
of the Chamber and Privy Councillor to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary.
At the suppression of the religious houses under Henry VIII., he was “appointed
one of the Commissioners for visiting them, and afterwards was made
one of the auditors of the Court of Augmentation,” which was instituted for the
purpose of augmenting the revenues by the suppression of the monasteries; for
his services he received three valuable manors in Hertfordshire which, later on,
he exchanged for other lands, in Derbyshire and other counties. He was also
knighted by Henry VIII. By his first wife he had issue, one son and two
daughters who died young, and two other daughters, one of whom, Catherine,
married Sir Thomas Brooke, son of Lord Cobham, and Anne, who married Sir
Henry Baynton. By his second wife he had three daughters, who all died
young, and she herself died in child-birth. By his third marriage, with “Bess
of Hardwick,” he had a numerous family, viz.:&mdash;Henry Cavendish, of Tutbury,
Member of Parliament for Derbyshire, who married Grace, daughter of George,
Earl of Shrewsbury, but died without lawful issue; Sir William Cavendish,
created Earl of Devonshire, of whom hereafter; Sir Charles Cavendish, of
Bolsover Castle and of Welbeck Abbey (whose son, William Cavendish, by his
first wife, was created Duke, Marquis, and Earl of Newcastle, Baron Ogle,
Baron Cavendish, of Bolsover, Viscount Mansfield, K.G., Commander-in-Chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
&amp;c., &amp;c., and was the author of the splendid work on Horsemanship, &amp;c.,
and whose life was charmingly written by his wife, Margaret Lucas, Maid of
Honour to Queen Henrietta), ancestor of the Dukes of Newcastle, Portland,
&amp;c.; Frances, married to Sir Henry Pierrepoint, ancestor to the Dukes of
Kingston; Elizabeth, married to Charles Stuart, Duke of Lennox (younger
brother of Lord Darnley, the husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, and father of
King James I.), the issue of which marriage was the sadly unfortunate lady,
Arabella Stuart; and Mary, married to Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>Sir William Cavendish was created Baron Cavendish, of Hardwick, and
Earl of Devonshire, by King James I., “at which time of his creation, his
majesty stood under a cloth of state in the hall at Greenwich, accompanied
with the princes, his children, the Duke of Holstein, the Duke of Lennox, and
the greatest part of the nobility, both of England and Scotland.” His lordship
was one of the first adventurers who settled a colony and plantation in
Virginia, and on the discovery of the Bermuda Islands, he and others had a
grant of them from the king, one of the cantons being called after him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
married twice&mdash;his first wife being Anne, daughter of Henry Kighley, of
Kighley, by whom he had issue, besides William, his successor, Gilbert, who
died without issue; Frances, wife of Lord Maynard; and three others, who
died in infancy: by his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward
Boughton, and widow of Sir Richard Wortley, he had a son, Sir John
Cavendish. His lordship’s successor was his second son, Sir William (who
had been under the tuition of Thomas Hobbes, of whom more will be said on
subsequent pages); he married Christian, only daughter of Edward, Lord Bruce,
of Kinloss, a kinswoman of the king, “who gave her, with his own hand, and
made her fortune ten thousand pounds.” By her he had three sons and one
daughter, viz.:&mdash;William, his successor; Charles, who was Lieutenant-General
of Horse to his cousin the Earl of Newcastle, and was slain at Gainsborough;
Henry, who died young; and Anne, wife of Lord Rich, eldest son of the Earl
of Warwick.</p>

<p>William Cavendish, third Earl of Devonshire, was only ten years of age
when his father died, and he was placed, as we have just said, under the care
of Hobbes, who travelled and remained with him, and was, for the rest of his
life, supported by the earl’s family. The earl married Elizabeth Cecil, daughter
of the Earl of Salisbury, by whom he had two sons, William (who succeeded
him), Charles, and one daughter. William, fourth Earl of Devonshire, before
succeeding to the title, sat in the Long Parliament for Derbyshire, and, as a
youth, he was one of the train-bearers to the king at his coronation. He was
among the principal persons who brought about the “Glorious Revolution” of
1688, and the placing of William III. on the throne. He married Mary,
daughter of the Duke of Ormonde, and had issue by her, William, his
successor; Henry, James, and Elizabeth. His lordship was the rebuilder of
Chatsworth, and was by William III. advanced to the dignity of Marquis of
Hartington and Duke of Devonshire. He was succeeded in his titles and
estates by his son. His Grace died in 1707, and his funeral sermon, preached
by White Kennett, Bishop of Peterborough, has been many times printed, and
is attached to the memoirs of the family of Cavendish by that prelate.</p>

<p>William Cavendish, second Duke and fifth Earl of Devonshire, was Captain
of the Yeomen of the Guard, and succeeded to all his father’s appointments,
among which were Lord Steward of the Household, Privy Councillor, Lord
Warden and Chief Justice in Eyre of all places north of the Trent, Lord-Lieutenant,
K.G.; he was also constituted one of the regents of the kingdom.
He married Rachel, daughter of William Lord Russell, and by her had issue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with several others, his successor, William, who became third Duke of Devonshire,
and married Catherine, heiress of John Hoskins, by whom he had a
numerous family. His Grace held many important posts in the State; among
which were those of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire,
Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, Lord Steward of the Household, and
Lord Justiceship for the administration of Government during his Majesty’s
absence. He was succeeded by his son&mdash;</p>

<p>William, fourth Duke of Devonshire, who was, during his father’s lifetime,
called to the Upper House by his title, hitherto of courtesy, of Marquis of
Hartington. He was appointed Master of the Horse and a Privy Councillor.
In 1754 he was one of the Lords of the Regency, and Governor of the County
of Cork; in the following year he was Lord High Treasurer of Ireland; and
in 1756 was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and First Commissioner of the
Treasury. In 1757 he was Chamberlain of the Household to the king, and
held, besides, many other offices. His Grace married Charlotte, daughter, and
ultimately heiress, of Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington and Cork, by which
union&mdash;the lady being Baroness Clifford in her own right&mdash;the Barony of
Clifford came into the Cavendish family. By this issue he had three sons and
one daughter, viz.:&mdash;William, who succeeded him; Richard, who died unmarried;
George Augustus Henry, created Earl of Burlington, from whom the
present noble representative of the House of Cavendish, the seventh Duke of
Devonshire, is descended; and Dorothy, married to the Duke of Portland.</p>

<p>William, fifth Duke of Devonshire, the eldest son of the last named peer,
was married twice: first, to the Lady Georgiana, daughter of Earl Spencer,
one of the most accomplished and elegant women of the time, and who is
perhaps better known as “The Beautiful Duchess” than by any other name;
and, secondly, to Lady Elizabeth Foster, daughter of the Earl of Bristol, and
widow of John Thomas Foster, Esq. By the “Beautiful Duchess” his grace
had issue, one son, William Spencer Cavendish, who succeeded him, and two
daughters: Georgiana, married to the Earl of Carlisle; and Harriet Elizabeth,
married to Earl Granville. On his death, in 1811, the title and estates passed
to his only son&mdash;</p>

<p>William Spencer Cavendish, sixth Duke and ninth Earl of Devonshire, one
of the most liberal-minded of men and one of the most genuine patrons of Art
and Literature. His Grace, whose career earned for him the proud title of
“The good Duke”&mdash;a title which, with all his others, has descended to his
successor&mdash;was born in Paris in 1790, and besides holding office as Lord High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Chamberlain, &amp;c., went in a style of more than princely splendour on an
embassy to Russia from the British Court, and so conducted that important
mission as to gain exceeding distinction and general applause. His Grace, who
never married, died in 1858, and was succeeded in his titles and estates&mdash;with
the exception of the Barony of Clidord, which fell in abeyance between his
sisters&mdash;by his second cousin, the present noble peer, who, as we have said,
was grandson to the first Earl of Burlington, brother to the fifth duke.</p>

<p>The present peer, William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, Marquis of
Hartington, Earl of Devonshire, Earl of Burlington, Baron Cavendish of Hardwick,
Baron Cavendish of Keighley, &amp;c., &amp;c., K.G., LL.D., F.R.S., Lord
Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the County of Derby, Chancellor of the
University of Cambridge, Steward of the Borough of Derby, &amp;c., &amp;c., was born
in 1808, and was educated at Eton, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where
he graduated as M.A., and was Second Wrangler, Senior Smith’s Prizeman,
and in the first class of the Classical Tripos, 1829. In the same year he
became M.P. for the University of Cambridge, which he held until 1831, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
he was returned for Malton, and afterwards for North Derbyshire, for which
constituency he sat until he succeeded his father as Earl of Burlington, in 1834.
In 1856 he was made Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, a post he held until 1858,
when, on attaining to the Dukedom of Devonshire, he was appointed Lord
Lieutenant of Derbyshire. From 1836 to 1856 he was Chancellor of the
University of London, and he has held, and still holds, several other important
offices. In 1829 his Grace, then Mr. Cavendish, married his cousin, the Lady
Blanche Georgiana Howard, fourth daughter of George, sixth Earl of Carlisle,
by the Lady Georgiana Dorothy Cavendish, daughter of the fifth Duke of
Devonshire. By this truly estimable lady, who died in 1840, his Grace had
surviving issue, three sons and one daughter, viz.:&mdash;Spencer Compton
Cavendish, Marquis of Hartington; Lord Frederick Charles Cavendish, M.P.
for the West Riding of Yorkshire, Private Secretary to the Right Hon. W. E.
Gladstone, married to the Hon. Lucy Caroline, daughter of Baron Lyttelton;
Lord Edward Cavendish, late M.P. for East Sussex, married to Emma,
daughter of the late Hon. William Lascelles; and the Lady Louisa Cavendish,
married to Rear-Admiral the Hon. Francis Egerton, M.P. for East Derbyshire,
brother to the late, and uncle to the present, Earl of Ellesmere.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Hartington, the heir to the titles and estates, was born in
1833, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as
B.A. in 1852, M.A. in 1854, and LL.D. in 1862. He is a Privy Councillor,
and was Lord of the Admiralty in 1863, Undersecretary of State for War from
1863 to 1866; Secretary of State for War in 1866; and Postmaster-General
from 1868 to 1871. He was attached to Lord Granville’s special mission to
Russia in 1856, and has filled many important posts. His lordship, who is
unmarried, is M.P. for Radnor, and is now Secretary of State for Ireland.</p>

<p>Lord George Henry Cavendish, brother to the Duke of Devonshire,
is M.P. for North Derbyshire, which constituency he has represented
since the year 1834. He married in 1835 the Lady Louisa, daughter
of the Earl of Harewood. Lord Richard Cavendish, another brother of the
duke, is unmarried.</p>

<p>His Grace is patron of thirty-nine livings, and in Derbyshire alone is Lord
of the Manor of forty-six places.</p>

<p>The arms of the duke are&mdash;<i>Sable</i>, three harts’ heads, caboshed, <i>argent</i>,
attired <i>or</i>. Crest, a serpent, noued, <i>proper</i>. Supporters, two bucks, <i>proper</i>,
each wreathed round the neck with a chaplet of roses, alternately <i>argent</i> and
<i>azure</i>.</p>

<p>We now, for the present, leave the genealogical part of our story to turn to
the attractions of the interior of the Hall. Of the exterior and interior of the
old hall and their surroundings we shall speak later on.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Grand Staircase.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Passing through the entrance gateway, shown in one of our illustrations,
the visitor to Hardwick will see before him, across the quadrangular space laid
out in magnificent flower-beds in the pure Elizabethan style&mdash;the most striking
feature of which are two immense beds, one on either side the central pathway,
formed in the shape of the letters E and S, the initials of Elizabeth, Countess
of Shrewsbury&mdash;in all its grandeur, the principal front of the Hall, which bears
out to the full the truth of the common saying&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Hardwick Hall,<br />
More glass than wall.”</p>

<p class="pn1">The house is in reality “all windows,” and has a peculiarity of appearance
possessed by no other existing mansion. Passing under the colonnade, seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
in the centre of the building in our illustration on page 122, the visitor arrives
at the entrance door, and will, before entering, do well to glance at an inscription,
now nearly defaced, on one of the pillars:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Hic locus est quem si verbis audacia detur<br />
Haud meum magni dixisse palatia coeli,”</p>

<p class="pn1">which may be thus freely rendered:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Could any adventurous muse these portals sing,<br />
No more to Heaven’s gate her flight she’d wing.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <span class="smcap">Great Hall</span>, which is first entered, is of considerable magnitude, and
very lofty, taking in the whole height of two stories of the noble building. Its
lower part is wainscoted; its upper, hung with fine Gobelins tapestry. Along
one side stands an enormous and massive oak table, and carved chairs and seats
in abundance are ranged around the room. Over the entrance end a spacious
gallery, supported on pillars, leads from the dining-room to the drawing-room,
on the first floor; and at the opposite end is a charming piece of sculpture, a
full-length statue of Mary, Queen of Scots, by Westmacott, with the inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Maria Scotorum Regina</p>
<p class="pp10">Nata 1542</p>
<p class="pp6">A suis in exilium acta 1568<br />
Ab hospita neci data 1587.”</p>

<p class="pn1">On the wall over this is a large and very curious cartoon full-length figure of
Henry VIII. On the wainscot and in different parts of the hall are some fine
antlers, a series of helmets and breastplates, and other relics; while over the
fire-place, which is of great size and beauty, and has its original brass fire-dogs,
are the arms of the foundress of the house, Elizabeth (Hardwick), Countess of
Shrewsbury, of gigantic size, in raised plaster-work. Some remarks here seem
requisite concerning the heraldry of the place. The arms represented in the
great hall, and shown in our engraving of that splendid apartment, are <i>argent</i>,
a saltire, engrailed, <i>azure</i>; on a chief of the second three cinquefoils of the
field. These, which are in a lozenge-shaped shield, are surmounted by an
earl’s coronet, and have for supporters, two stags, <i>proper</i>, each gorged with a
chaplet of roses, <i>argent</i>, between two bars <i>azure</i>. The arms are those of
Hardwick of Hardwick, the maiden name of the Countess; the supporters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
which she had no right to assume, the family of Hardwick not being entitled
to any, were assumed from the crest of that family, which, with a slight
variation, formed those granted to her son, the first Baron Cavendish, of Hardwick,
and Earl of Devonshire. The coronet is, of course, hers as Countess of
Shrewsbury, the hall being built during the latter part of the life of her <i>fourth</i>
husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, and in the first nine years of her fourth
widowhood. From the Great Hall a wide passage to the right leads to the
grand staircase, the muniment-room, the sitting and other rooms, on the
ground-floor, and, to the left, to the kitchens and offices, and to another staircase.
Ascending these massive stone stairs hung with framed pieces of needlework
and with curious old paintings, some of which are dated 1576, and were
principally brought from the old hall, an open oak screen-work on the landing
opens into</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Chapel.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Chapel.</span> In this truly interesting little room, the walls are notable
for being partly hung with painted tapestry of extremely good character, and
the only examples in the house. On the ceiling is a fine piece of tapestry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
representing our Lord, with two of His disciples, blessing the bread. The pulpit
is dressed with some of the earliest embroidery&mdash;portions of a cope, &amp;c.; and
on the rails hangs a very rich and curious altar-cloth, 80 feet long, with figures
of saints under canopies, wrought in very rich and early needlework. The
chapel is shown in one of our illustrations. On the landing hangs a remarkably
curious lantern.</p>

<p>Opposite to the chapel, a doorway opens into the <span class="smcap">Dining-room</span>, a noble
apartment, the lower part of the walls being wainscoted, and the upper hung
with a number of family portraits, amongst which are an interesting painting
of “Bess of Hardwick,” with this inscription upon it:&mdash;“Elizabeth Hardwick,
daughter and co-heir of John Hardwick, of Hardwick, in the county of Derby.
To her second husband, Sir William Cavendish, of Chatsworth, in the same
county. She settled her third son, Sir Charles Cavendish, at Welbeck, in the
county of Nottingham.” Other portraits are those of her husband, Sir William
Cavendish, at the age of forty-four; “the Beautiful Duchess,” Georgiana,
Duchess of Devonshire; the late Duke of Devonshire; Lord George Cavendish,
second son of the third duke, known as “Truth and Daylight,” &amp;c., &amp;c. Over
the fire-place is a fine specimen of parget-work, a kind of plaster-stone, with
figures, &amp;c., and in the centre the inscription, “The conclusion of all things is
to feare God and keepe his Commaundementes,” and the conjoined initials
E.S. with the date 1597. The large recess of this room is converted into a
billiard-room.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cut-Velvet Room</span>, leading from the dining-room, is a noble apartment,
hung with tapestry, and containing a stately bed with plumes. Over the fire-place,
in parget-work, as in other rooms, is a series of armorial bearings,
among which again occur the arms of Hardwick, with supporters and coronet.
Adjoining this is a charming dressing-room, hung with the most exquisite
needlework in silk. Passing down the minstrels’ gallery from the dining-room
to the drawing-room, some fine specimens of needlework, by the Countess of
Shrewsbury, and by Mary, Queen of Scots, are carefully preserved in frames.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Drawing-Room</span> is a large well-proportioned apartment, the lower part of
the walls wainscoted, and the upper hung with fine old tapestry, representing
the story of Esther and Ahasuerus. Over the fire-place are the arms of Hardwick,
with quarterings, in a lozenge shield, supporters, and coronet. Among
the paintings will be specially noticed a fine portrait of Arabella Stuart, several
portraits by Holbein, and others of Henry VII. and VIII., Edward VI., &amp;c.,
&amp;c. There are, also, some curious pieces of needlework, framed.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Presence Chamber.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From the drawing-room the <span class="smcap">Duke’s Bed Room</span>, and other apartments, are
reached. This room, so called because it is the room occupied by the late
Duke of Devonshire, and in which he died, is a splendid apartment, hung with
tapestry representing scriptural subjects. Over the fire-place, which has large
carved figures in stone on either side, is a fine piece of parget-work surrounding
a painting. On the bed a curious needlework counterpane invites attention.
The dressing-room adjoining is one of the most interesting in the house. It is
hung with silk needlework tapestry of the finest and most choice character,
one piece of which bears the date of 1574. There are also paintings of the
entombment of our Saviour, and of the Annunciation, with the arms, in
tapestry, of the Cavendishes, Talbots, and others. Near this room is the bed-room
occupied, on his occasional visits to Hardwick, by the present duke, on
the tapestry of which cupids are represented playing at mall&mdash;the progenitor,
apparently, of our modern croquet. Near this, too, is the Marquis of Hartington’s
room, in which are several interesting coats of arms in parget-work, including
the bearings of Hardwick, Cavendish, Talbot, and others. Returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
through the drawing-room, the visitor next passes out to the <span class="smcap">Grand Staircase</span>,
of which we give an engraving. Near the drawing-room door will be noticed a
fine old chest, said to have belonged to the Earl of Shrewsbury. The staircase
is hung with some of the finest tapestry which any house can boast. One
portion represents a classical story; the boar-hunts and similar subjects are
fine, and powerful in the extreme. On the second landing is an interesting
inlaid table with the arms of Hardwick impaling Talbot, and on the wall by it
hangs some of the oldest tapestry in the house. Continuing up the staircase,
with tapestry on either side, the state-rooms are approached. The entrance is
by a doorway surmounted by the Hardwick arms, over which is the most gorgeously
fine piece of tapestry, representing Juno. On the door a marvellously
beautiful lock is still preserved. It, with the arms of Hardwick, forms one of
our initial letters. This door opens into the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Presence-Chamber</span>, State-Room, or Audience-Room, as it is variously
called. This splendid apartment, which is 65 feet long, 33 feet wide, and 26
feet in height, is one of the finest proportioned and most imposing in appearance
even in this perfect house. The upper portion of the walls of this magnificent
chamber is covered with parget-work in high coloured-relief, representing
hunting scenes, Orpheus, and the court of Diana. Below this, for full 15 feet
in height, the walls are hung with tapestry of the finest character.</p>

<p>Over the fire-place of this room are the arms and supporters of Queen
Elizabeth, in coloured relief parget-work. The furniture is remarkably fine, as
will be seen from our engraving of this room. At the north end is a majestic
canopy, decorated in minute needlework with figures of the cardinal virtues,
“Verecundia,” “Prudentia,” “Sobrietas,” &amp;c., alternating with monograms
and arms of the family. Under the canopy is a state-chair; and in front, one
of the most curious and interesting tables in existence. It is of large size, and
elaborately inlaid over the entire surface of its top with musical instruments of
various kinds, backgammon and chess boards, cards, and various games,
foliage and other devices. In its centre is a tablet with the quaint inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi6 p1">THE REDOLENT SMLE<br />
OF ÆGLENTYNE<br />
WE STAGGES EXAVLT<br />
TO THE DEVEYNE.</p>

<p class="pn1">The “stagges” being, no doubt, the stags of the Hardwick arms. On each
side of the tablet are the arms of Hardwick and Talbot impaled, &amp;c. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
this room a doorway in the tapestry opens into the picture-gallery, and another
at the north end leads into the <span class="smcap">Library</span>, over the chimney-piece of which is a
splendid piece of sculpture, Apollo and the Muses; over the figures on one side
are the arms of Queen Elizabeth, and on the other her initials, E. R., in a
knot, and crowned. This fine group, found not many years ago in a case in
one of the servants’ rooms at Chatsworth, is supposed to have been presented
to the countess by Queen Elizabeth, and it has, therefore, been most appropriately
brought and placed in its present position. In this room, among other
interesting pictures, is a portrait of James V. of Scotland, when very young.
It belonged to Queen Mary, and was taken with her from place to place.
Passing through the library and the <span class="smcap">Green Bed-Room</span>, where the majestic state-bed
and the tapestry are sure to excite attention, one of the most interesting
little rooms in the whole building is gained:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>Mary Queen of Scots’ Room.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Queen of Scots’ Room</span>&mdash;a room which, it appears to us, the Countess
of Shrewsbury prepared expressly for the reception of the furniture used by
the truly unfortunate captive who had for so many years been a prisoner in
charge of her and her husband, and in which, when finished, she placed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
bed and other furniture, so as to preserve them as precious relics. On the
panels of the wainscoting of the room are the initials of the countess, E.S.,
with the coronet and the date 1599; and on the door the same date twice
occurs. The woodwork is “tricked” in arabesque patterns; over the door, on
the interior side, are carved the royal arms of Scotland, with the order of St.
Andrew, supporters, crown, &amp;c., and the letters M. S., and the motto, <span class="smcap lowercase">IN · MY ·
DE · FENS</span>. Around the whole is the inscription, <span class="smcap lowercase">MARIE · STEWART · PAR · LA ·
GRACE · DE · DIEV · ROYNE · DE · SCOSSE · DOVARIERE · DE · FRANCE</span>. Over the
fire-place, in parget-work, are the arms of Hardwick in lozenge, with coronet
and supporters; the arms of Hardwick impaling Leake; and those of Cavendish,
with a crescent for difference, impaling <i>argent</i> a fesse <i>gules</i>. The bed&mdash;the
very one in which the poor queen lay during a part of her captivity&mdash;is
adorned with the work of her own hands, bearing her monogram. The
counterpane, too, is an elaborate piece of needlework, said to be her own
work; and some of the furniture is of the same period. We have engraved
this historically interesting room as one of our illustrations.</p>

<p>Near this is the <span class="smcap">Blue Bed-Room</span>, hung with tapestry, and containing a
noble bed, hung with blue, to which needlework by Christian Bruce, Countess
of Devonshire, has been transferred with much judgment and care. Over the
chimney-piece is the “Marriage of Tobias.” Other bed-rooms adjoin, which it
is not necessary to notice.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Picture-Gallery</span>, the “great glory” of Hardwick, occupies the entire
length of the building from north to south, on the upper floor of its eastern
front. Its length is 170 feet, and its width 40 feet, including the recessed
windows; its height being 26 feet. The walls of this superb gallery are hung
with the finest tapestry, almost hidden, however, by the magnificent assemblage
of portraits with which it is, as will be seen from our engraving, literally
covered. The tapestry here is, as has been said, remarkably fine, and is very
early, some of it bearing the date of 1478. It was brought from the old
mansion and from Chatsworth. The gallery is lit by eighteen enormous
windows, each 20 feet in height, on its eastern side, which is deeply recessed.
In the centre of this side is a gorgeous canopy over the state seat, bearing the
monogram of W.D., with a coronet; and on the western side are two gigantic
chimney-pieces, reaching from the floor to the cornice, composed of Derbyshire
black marble, alabaster, and other marbles, one bearing in the centre of its
upper height a finely sculptured figure of Pity, and the other that of Justice.
They are said to be the work of “Stephens, a Flemish sculptor, or of Valerio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Vicentino.” The ceiling is of geometric design, in raised plaster-work; it
gives that finish to the room which is wanting in other of the apartments.
The upper portion of the walls, above the wainscoting and arras, is worked in
panels and festoons.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Picture-Gallery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The furniture is of the most costly and curious character, and in perfect
preservation. Much of it, indeed, belongs to the time, or to a time not much
later, when the house was constructed, and indicates the artistic feeling and
manual dexterity of the foundress. Here are beds of state, with their curtains
of black and silver; Venetian velvets and damascenes; “cloth of Raynes to
slepe on softe,” and hangings “raied with gold;” hard cushions of blue
baudekyn; high-seated chairs, covered with samit and powdered with flowers,
yet most uncomfortable for use; screens of crimson velvet, covered with
patterns worked in silver wires; couches, every portion of which is thickly
overlaid with threads of silver and of gold; tables with legs twisted and turned
about in the most picturesque manner; fire-dogs of gorgeous description; and
a magnificent giant-glass, with the arms of Devonshire impaling Ormonde&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
are among the beauties which greet the eye at every turn in its progress
through Hardwick.</p>

<p>As we said at the commencement of this chapter, there is no place so likely
as Hardwick to carry the mind back to those times which we have indicated
and to which it belongs. One is unresistingly and forcibly carried by the
imagination back to the time of Elizabeth, and while pacing along through
these rooms, we are led, “in the mind’s eye,” to people them with the forms
of those who lived and moved and had their being within its walls.</p>

<p>To the paintings in the picture-gallery and those scattered through the
several rooms, the dining-room more especially, we can but make slight
reference. They count some hundreds of the finest and most historically
interesting portraits of which any mansion can boast. To enumerate them
would occupy a dozen of our pages: we must, therefore, be content to say
that among them are original portraits of Queen Elizabeth; of Mary, Queen of
Scots; of Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia; of Arabella Stuart; of the foundress
of the building, “Bess of Hardwick,” afterwards Countess of Shrewsbury; of
Kings Henry VII. and Henry VIII.; of Georgiana, the “Beautiful Duchess”
of Devonshire; of Robert Boyle, the philosopher; of the seventh and unfortunate
Earl of Derby; of Lord Treasurer Burleigh; of Queen Mary; of
Sir William St. Loe, third husband of “Bess of Hardwick;” of George, sixth
Earl of Shrewsbury; of Henry VII. and Henry VIII., cartoons by Holbein;
of James V. of Scotland, and his queen; of Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury; of
Mary, Countess of Shrewsbury; of Lady Grace Talbot; of several distinguished
members of the Clifford family; of Queen Catherine of Arragon; of
Christian, Countess of Devonshire; of Lady Jane Seymour; of Elizabeth,
Countess of Devonshire; of the first Duke of Ormond; of Rachel, Duchess of
Devonshire; of Edward Russell, Duke of Bedford; of John, first Duke of
Rutland; of Henry Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel; of William, Lord Russell; of

<p>Having described <span class="smcap">Hardwick Hall</span> as it now exists,
and given a brief history of the noble family of
Cavendish to whom it belongs, we resume the
subject, to speak of the older mansion, now in
ruins; of the Hardwicks to whom it belonged;
of the marvellous daughter of that house,
“Bess of Hardwick,” and her alliances; and
of <span class="smcap">Ault Hucknall</span>, the parish church, and its
many monuments, among which is that to the
great philosopher, “Hobbes of Malmesbury,”
who lived and died at Hardwick.</p>

<p>And, first, as to the family.</p>

<p>The family of Hardwick is one of considerable
antiquity in the county of Derby, although now extinct, and
was for several generations settled at Hardwick, from which
place, indeed, it is probable the name was assumed.</p>

<p>In 1203 the manor of Hardwick was granted by King John to
Andrew de Beauchamp, but in 1288 it was held of John le Savage&mdash;who
owned the neighbouring manor of Steynsby, and was
probably of the same family as the later Savages, of Castleton
and other places&mdash;by William de Steynsby, by the annual render of <i>three
pounds of cinnamon and one pound of pepper</i>. The grandson of William de
Steynsby, John Steynsby, died seized of the manor in 1330. It afterwards
passed into the hands of the Hardwicks, and was held by them until it passed
to the Cavendishes by the marriage of the heiress to Sir William Cavendish.
The first of the Hardwick family known was William, who married the daughter
of Goushill, of Barlborough (which family of Goushill, in the time of Henry III.,
married the heiress of Hathersage, and whose heiress, in the sixteenth century,
married Wingfield), and by her had two sons, Roger and William, the latter of
whom was living in the thirty-second year of Henry VI. Roger Hardwick, of
Hardwick, married the daughter of Robert Barley, of Barley, and had issue
by her, John, who succeeded him. John Hardwick, of Hardwick, married
Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Bakewell, of Bakewell, one of the co-heiresses
of which family married Linacre before the year 1400. By her he had issue,
a son, John Hardwick, who, marrying Elizabeth, daughter of &mdash; Pinchbeck, of
Pinchbeck, was, in turn, succeeded by his son, John Hardwick, who married
Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Leake, of Hasland, a younger branch of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Leakes, Earls of Scarsdale. By this lady John Hardwick, who died January
24, 1527, had issue, one son and four daughters, viz., John, Mary, Elizabeth,
Alice, and Jane. John Hardwick, the last male representative of the family,
who was only three years old at his father’s death, married Elizabeth, daughter
of Philip Draycott, of Paynsley, but died without issue, leaving his sisters his
co-heiresses. Of these, Mary married, first, Wingfield, and, second, one of the
Pollards, of Devonshire, who was Gentleman Usher to the Queen; Alice
married Francis Leech, of Chatsworth, and died without issue; Jane married
Godfrey Bosville of Gunthwaite; and Elizabeth (“Bess of Hardwick”)
married, first, Robert Barley, of Barley; second, Sir William Cavendish;
third, Sir William St. Loe; and fourth, Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury. The
Francis Leech just named, who married “Bess’s” sister Alice, was the last of
his family. He sold Chatsworth to Agard, who resold it to the second husband
of “Bess,” Sir William Cavendish, by whom it was rebuilt in almost regal
magnificence.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Hardwick was, it will have been seen, one of the co-heiresses of
her father, and ultimately heiress to her brother, from whom she inherited
Hardwick and other estates. She was a most remarkable, clever, and accomplished
woman, and one of the most successful, in her many marriages, in
her acquisition of property, in the alliances of her family, and in the erection
of magnificent mansions; and no account of Hardwick would be complete
without, at all events, a brief notice of her extraordinary and brilliant career.
When very young&mdash;indeed, it is said, when scarcely fourteen years of age&mdash;Elizabeth
Hardwick became the wife of Robert Barley, of Barley (or Barlow),
in the county of Derby, son of Arthur Barley, of Barley-by-Dronfield, by his
wife, Elizabeth Chaworth. This young gentleman, who was devotedly attached
to his young and charming wife, died within a few months after their
marriage, leaving his possessions to her. By this short marriage there was no
issue. Remaining a young, indeed childlike, widow for some twelve years or
thereabouts, she then married Sir William Cavendish, as detailed in our former
chapter, and so brought to him the possessions of the Hardwicks, which she
had inherited from her father and brother, as well as those of the Barleys,
acquired by her first marriage. By Sir William Cavendish she had a family of
three sons and three daughters, viz., Henry Cavendish, of Tutbury, ancestor
of the Barons Waterpark; Sir William Cavendish, of Chatsworth, created
Baron Cavendish of Hardwick, and Earl of Devonshire, and ancestor of the
present Ducal house of Devonshire; Sir Charles Cavendish, of Bolsover Castle,
ancestor of the Barons Cavendish, Viscounts Mansfield, Earls, Marquises, and
Dukes of Newcastle; Frances, wife of the Duke of Kingston; Elizabeth, wife
of Charles Stuart, Duke of Lennox, and mother by him of Arabella Stuart;
and Mary, wife of Gilbert, seventh Earl of Shrewsbury.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Hardwick Hall, from the Park.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Sir William Cavendish
died in 1557, and his lady was thus a second time left a widow. A few years
later she married her third husband, Sir William St. Loe, Captain of the Guard
to Queen Elizabeth, “owner of a great estate, which,” as Bishop Kennett says,
“in articles of marriage she took care should be settled on her and her own
heirs, in default of issue; and, accordingly, having no child by him, she liv’d
to enjoy his whole estate, excluding his former daughters and brothers;” thus
adding his property to the already immense possessions she had acquired in
her own right and by her two former marriages. The death of Sir William
left her for the third time a widow; but she was soon after wooed and won by
George, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, who had not long before lost his countess,
Gertrude Manners, daughter of the Earl of Rutland. Before she would consent,
however, to be united to the first peer of the realm, she stipulated that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
he should give his daughter to her eldest son, and that Gilbert Talbot, his
second son (the eldest being already married) should espouse her youngest
daughter. These family nuptials were solemnised at Sheffield on the 9th of
February, 1567-8; her daughter being at the time not quite twelve years old,
and her husband being under fifteen. Gilbert Talbot became seventh Earl of
Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>The history of the events of her life while Countess of Shrewsbury is that
of the kingdom at large; for it was during this time, from 1568 to 1584, that
Mary, Queen of Scots, was confided to the care of the earl and his lady, and
by them was kept a close prisoner. Into these annals&mdash;known by every
student of English history&mdash;it is not our province now to enter. Suffice it to
say, that the wearisome task, imposed by a rigorous and arbitrary sovereign,
was executed with a zeal and with a diligence that were worthy a far better
cause. In 1568 the earl received from his royal mistress the intimation of the
trust she was about to confide to him, and on the 20th of the following
January, 1569, the order for removing Mary from Bolton to Tutbury was
made. Here the poor captive was received by the Earl and Countess of
Shrewsbury; and here, kept a close prisoner, she remained for several months,
passing her time as best she might in needlework. “I asked hir grace,” says
White, “sence the wether did cutt of all exercises abrode, howe passed the
tyme within? She sayd that all the day she wrought with hir nydill, and that
the diversitie of the colours made the worke seme lesse tedious, and contynued
so long at it till veray payn made hir to give over; and with that layd hir
hand upon hir left syde and complayned of an old grief newely increased
there.” In June the earl removed her to Wingfield Manor, in Derbyshire,
now, like Tutbury itself, a splendid ruin; and later on in the same year back
again to Tutbury. In 1570 Mary was removed to Chatsworth, and from thence
to Sheffield, also now a ruin. Here she remained, occasionally staying at
Chatsworth for some length of time. In 1584 she was again removed to
Wingfield, in 1585 to Tutbury, and in the following year to Chartley, to
Fotheringhay, and that fatal block, which will ever remain a dark blot on the
escutcheon of “good Queen Bess.” It is a somewhat remarkable circumstance,
touching the captivity of Mary under the constableship of the Earl of
Shrewsbury, that the places belonging to him where she was confined, Sheffield
Castle and Manor, Tutbury Castle, Wingfield Manor, and Chartley (as well as
Fotheringhay, where she was executed), have all fallen to ruin, while Chatsworth
and other places which belonged to the countess still flourish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not certain, although there is every probability that such was the case,
that Mary was ever at Hardwick. There can be but little doubt she spent, at
all events, a few days there; but this would, of course, be at the old Hall, as
will be shown later on.</p>

<p>The Earl of Shrewsbury, about whom strange rumours regarding his
conduct and intentions towards his captive at the time of his discharge from
his trust were afloat, and over whom a female domestic, Eleanor Britton, had
gained an injurious ascendency, afterwards, in consequence, living a not very
happy life with his second countess, died in 1590; and thus “Bess of Hardwick”
became, for the fourth time, a widow. “A change of conditions,” says
Bishop Kennett, “that, perhaps, never fell to the lot of one woman, to be four
times a creditable and happy wife, to rise by every husband into greater
wealth and higher honours, to have a numerous issue by one husband only; to
have all those children live, and all, by her advice, be creditably disposed of in
her lifetime; and, after all, to live seventeen years a widow in absolute power
and plenty.”</p>

<p>The countess, besides being one of the most beautiful, accomplished, and
captivating women of her day, was, without exception, the most energetic,
business-like, and able of her sex. In architecture her conceptions were
grand; while in all matters pertaining to the Arts, and to comforts and
elegancies of life, she was unsurpassed. To the old Hall of her fathers, where
she was born and resided, she made vast additions&mdash;indeed, so much so as
almost to amount to a recreation of the place; and she entirely planned and
built three of the most gorgeous edifices of the time&mdash;Hardwick Hall, Chatsworth,
and Oldcotes&mdash;the first two of which were transmitted entire to the
first Duke of Devonshire. “At Hardwick she left the ancient seat of her
family standing, and at a small distance, still adjoining to her new fabric, <i>as if
she had a mind to preserve her Cradle, and set it by her Bed of State</i>,” as
Kennett so poetically expresses it.</p>

<p>Her “Bed of State”&mdash;the present Hall, erected by her&mdash;we have already
described. Her “Cradle”&mdash;the old Hall, wherein she was born and nursed,
but which is now in ruins&mdash;we shall describe presently.</p>

<p>The latter part of her long and busy life she occupied almost entirely in
building, and it is marvellous what an amount of real work&mdash;hard figures and
dry details&mdash;she got through; for it is a fact, abundantly evidenced by the
original accounts, remaining to this day, that not a penny was expended on her
buildings, and not a detail added or taken away, without her special attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and personal supervision. Building was a passion with her, and she indulged
it wisely and well, sparing neither time, nor trouble, nor outlay, to secure
everything being done in the most admirable manner. It is said, and it is so
recorded by Walpole, that the countess had once been told by a gipsy fortune-teller
that she would never die so long as she continued building, and she so
implicitly believed this, that she never ceased planning and contriving and
adding to her erections; and it is said that at last she died in a hard frost,
which totally prevented the workmen from continuing their labours, and so
caused an unavoidable suspension of her works. Surely the fortune-teller here
was a “wise woman” in more senses than one; for it was wise and cunning
in her to instil such a belief into the countess’s mind, and thus insure a continuance
of the works by which so many workmen and their families gained a
livelihood, and by which later generations would also benefit.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Old Hall at Hardwick.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Besides Hardwick, Chatsworth (for which a good part of the old Hall at
Hardwick was, at a later period, removed), Oldcotes, and other places, the
countess founded and built the Devonshire Almshouses at Derby, and did many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
other good and noble works. She died, full of years and full of honours and
riches, on the 23rd of February, 1607, and was buried in All Saints’ Church,
Derby, under a stately tomb which she had erected during her lifetime, and on
which a long Latin inscription is to be seen.</p>

<p>Of the countess&mdash;the “Bess of Hardwick,” who was one of the greatest
of the subjects of that other “Bess” who sat on the throne of England&mdash;portraits
are still preserved at Hardwick, and show that she must have been,
as Dugdale says of her, “faire and beautiful.” Whatever faults of temper or
of disposition she had&mdash;and she is said to have had plenty of both&mdash;she had
good qualities which, perhaps, outbalanced them; and she, at all events,
founded one of the most brilliant houses&mdash;that of Cavendish&mdash;which this
nation has ever produced.</p>

<p>The old Hall at Hardwick, of the ruins of which we give an engraving, was,
in its palmy days, a place of considerable extent and beauty, and from its
charming situation&mdash;being built on the edge of a rocky eminence overlooking
an immense tract of country&mdash;must have been a most desirable residence. In
it a long line of the ancestors of the countess were born, and lived, and died;
and in it she too was born and lived, as maiden, as four times wife, and four
times widow. In it, if Mary, Queen of Scots, was ever at Hardwick, she
must have been received, and in it the larger part of the great works of its
remarkable owner must have been planned. It was her “home,” and her
favourite residence; and it is said that when she began to build the new
Hall&mdash;which, as we have said, closely adjoins the old one&mdash;she still intended
making the older building her abode, and keeping the new one for state
receptions and purposes of hospitality. This plan, however, if ever laid down,
was ultimately discarded, and the old mansion, after all the improvements
which had been made in it, was in great measure stripped and dismantled for
the requirements of the new Hall, and of Chatsworth.</p>

<p>A tolerably good idea of the extent of the ruins of the old Hall will be
gained from our engraving, which shows, perhaps, its most imposing side, with
the green sward in front. In its interior, several rooms, in a more or less state
of dilapidation, still remain, and can be seen by the visitor. The kitchens,
with their wide chimneys, and the domestic offices on the ground-floor, amply
testify to the almost regal hospitality which must at one time have characterized
the place; while the chambers, the state-rooms, and the other apartments for
the family, testify to the magnificence of its appointments.</p>

<p>The principal remaining apartment&mdash;and of this we give an illustration&mdash;is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
at the top of that portion of the building which overlooks the valley. It is
called the “Giants’ Chamber,” taking its name from the two colossal figures in
Roman armour, which they term <i>Gog</i> and <i>Magog</i>, in raised plaster-work over
the fire-place. This pargetting is bold in the extreme, and in very high relief,
and the two figures, between which is a remarkably free and artistic winged
figure with a bow, must have had a wondrous effect as they frowned down
upon the gay throng assembled in olden times on the rush-strewn floors. The
room, which has been wainscoted, is 55 feet 6 inches in length, 30 feet 6
inches in width, and 24 feet 6 inches in height; and of it Bishop Kennett thus
speaks: “That old house has one room in it of such exact proportion, and
such convenient lights, that it has been thought fit for a pattern of measure
and contrivance to the most noble Blenheim.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>Interior of the Old Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In other apartments, pargetting of the same general character as distinguishes
the rooms in Hardwick Hall itself is to be seen over the fire-places.
In one place a figure or two; in another, animals of the chase; in a third, a
moated and fortified building; in another, armorial bearings; and in yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
another, the same motto&mdash;now from the dangerous state of the walls and floors
not discernible&mdash;which occurs on the fine old table described in our last&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The redolent smell of eglantyne<br />
We stagges exault to the devyne”&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">will be noticed, and all of the highest order of workmanship. Of the moated
and fortified building just alluded to, we give an engraving on our initial letter,
and beneath it, we have added the arms of the present noble house of
Cavendish.</p>

<p>We have, on a previous page, spoken of the marvellous aptitude for
business, and the careful attention to even the minutest details of expenditure,
&amp;c., evinced by the Countess of Shrewsbury, and we purpose now to make this
a little more evident by giving some particulars of the erection of Hardwick
Hall built by her.</p>

<p>The Hall, as it now stands&mdash;for it is, in every essential part, just as the
countess left it&mdash;was, it is thought, commenced about the year 1576, and
finished in 1599. The book of accounts of the wages paid is very curious and
interesting, and gives the names of all the various wallers, ditchers, stone
breakers, labourers, &amp;c., with the gardeners, thatchers, moss-getters, &amp;c.,
employed by the countess between January, 1576, and December, 1580. The
accounts are made up every fortnight during that time, and all the items are
carefully ticked off with a cross by the countess, and each fortnight’s accounts
signed by her. Of one of the signatures we have engraved a fac-simile: it
reads&mdash;“thre ponde hyght pence. <span class="smcap">E. Shrouesbury.</span>”</p>

round which almost countless herds of deer may be seen browsing. Some
of these trees are of gigantic size, of considerable girth, and of great beauty.

fine trees in the foreground.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Hault Hucknall Church.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hault Hucknall</span> (Haute Hucknall, as it is called in the early registers,
and Ault Hucknall, as it is now not unfrequently spelt) is the parish in
which Hardwick Hall stands; and it is therefore necessary, especially as the
two places are intimately connected in more ways than one, to say a few words
about its church and monuments. The church, which is dedicated to St. John
the Baptist, formerly belonged to the Abbey of Beauchief, but was, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
impropriate rectory, granted in 1544 to Francis Leake, from whom it passed to
the Cavendishes, and now belongs to the Marquis of Hartington. The church
contains some interesting remains of Norman and of Early English work,
among which are the aisle under the tower, the window in the west end of the
north aisle, and the old plain font,&mdash;the font now in use having been brought
here from Bamford Church in the same county. In the south wall of the
chancel is a pretty little piscina, and there are aumbries in the north aisle and
in the Hardwick Chapel. At these places it is supposed altars formerly stood,
and one of the altar-stones, with the five crosses emblematic of the five
wounds of our Saviour, may be seen forming one of the paving-stones of the
floor near the altar-rails. The porch has a vaulted stone-roof, and in the nave
are remains of wall-paintings.</p>

<p>Some portions of an elegant carved-oak screen which formerly separated the
Hardwick Chapel from the south aisle are still preserved, as are also several
of the original massive oak benches. In the east window of the Hardwick
Chapel, as shown in our engraving, the stained glass represents our Saviour
on the cross, with the figures of the Virgin Mary and of St. John, &amp;c. There
are also some kneeling figures, and the arms of Hardwick and of Savage.</p>

<p>Among the monuments in this interesting church are some deserving
especial attention. In the floor of the chancel is a monumental brass, the
figure belonging to which is unfortunately lost, commemorative of Richard
Pawson, 1536, sometime vicar of the parish, bearing the following inscription
in black letter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi6i p1 reduct">“Orate pro aia domini Ricardi Pawson Vicarii
Istius qui obiit die qua Vocavit eū d̄ns post an̄m
d̄ni millesimum quingentesimū tricesimū sextum
cujus aiē ppicietur deus. A.”</p>

<p class="p1">At the east end of the Hardwick Chapel, beneath the window, as shown
in the engraving on the next page, is an elegant tomb, of Derbyshire marble,
to the memory of Anne, daughter and co-heiress of Henry Kighley, of Kighley,
in Yorkshire, and first wife of the second Sir William Cavendish, created, after
her death, Baron Cavendish of Hardwick, and Earl of Devonshire. She was
the mother of William, second Earl of Devonshire, and Gilbert Cavendish,
author of “Horæ Subsecivæ,” Frances, wife of Lord Maynard, and James,
Mary, and Elizabeth, who all died young.</p>

<p>The most interesting tomb, however, in this pretty church, is that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Thomas Hobbes, who is best known as “Hobbes, of Malmesbury,” or as
“Leviathan Hobbes.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Grave of Hobbes of Malmesbury in Hault Hucknall Church.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The monument to this great “philosopher” and free-thinker
is a plain slab of stone in the Hardwick Chapel&mdash;the raised slab shown
on the floor in this engraving&mdash;which bears the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">Before speaking of Hobbes and his connection with Hardwick, where he
died, it will be well to note that the parish registers of Hault Hucknall commence
in the year 1662, and that the entry regarding the burial of Hobbes,

<p class="p1">Thomas Hobbes<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> was born at Malmesbury on Good Friday, 1588, in the
year of “the Spanish Armada,” and it is said that his birth was hastened by
his mother’s terror of the enemy’s fleet, and that a timidity with which
through life he was afflicted was thus induced. He and fear, he was wont to
say, “were born together.” His being born on Good Friday has also been
turned to account in the way of accounting for his wonderful precocity as a
child, and his subsequent intellectual progress. At the age of fifteen he was
sent to Oxford, and there made such progress that before he was twenty years
old he was taken into the service of Sir William Cavendish, who had a few
years before been created Baron Cavendish of Hardwick, as tutor to his sons,
Gilbert, who died before attaining his majority, and William, who became
second Earl of Devonshire. With the latter young nobleman, who married,
as already narrated, Christian, daughter of Lord Bruce, of Kinloss, Hobbes
travelled through France and Italy. At his death he left, besides other
issue, William, Lord Cavendish, who succeeded him as Earl of Devonshire,
and who, at that time, was only in the tenth year of his age. This
Lord Hardwick was, as his father had been before him, placed under the
tuition of Hobbes, “who instructed him in the family for three years, and
then, about 1634, travelled with him as his governor into France and Italy,
with the longest stay in Paris for all the politer parts of breeding. He
returned in 1637, and, when he soon after came of age, his mother (Christian,
Countess of Devonshire), delivered up to him his great houses in Derbyshire
all ready furnished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>With this nobleman (who married Elizabeth, daughter of the Earl of
Salisbury, and was succeeded by his son, afterwards created Duke of Devonshire)
Thomas Hobbes remained for the rest of his life. “The earl for his
whole life entertained Mr. Hobbes in his family as his old tutor rather than as
his friend or confidant; he let him live under his roof in ease and plenty and
his own way, without making use of him in any publick or so much as
domestick affairs. He would often express an abhorrence of some of his
principles in policy and religion; and both he and his lady would frequently
put off the mention of his name and say ‘He was an humourist, and that
nobody could account for him.’”</p>

<p>Of Hobbes’s works&mdash;of his “De Cive,” his “Leviathan,” his “Elémens
Philosophiques de Citoyen,” his “Behemoth,” or his hundred other writings&mdash;it
is, of course, not here our province to speak; but one of his smaller productions,
because of its connection with the family of his noble patron, his
“De Mirabilibus Pecci,” may claim a passing word. This is a Latin poem
descriptive of the “Wonders of the Peak, in Derbyshire”&mdash;the same subject
which Charles Cotton, later on, wrote upon in his “Wonders of the Peak”&mdash;wherein
Hobbes describes a tour which he, with a friend, took on horseback,
starting from Chatsworth, where he was residing, and visiting Pilsley, Hassop,
Hope, Castleton, Peak Forest, Eldon Hole, the Ebbing and Flowing Well,
Buxton, Poole’s Hole, Chelmorton, Sheldon, Ashford, and so back to Chatsworth,
quaintly describing all he saw on his journey.</p>

<p>If the earl was attached to Hobbes, he was at least amply repaid by the
devotion and fondness his old tutor showed to him and to his family. Indeed,
so intimate was the old man with the family of his patron, that whenever the
earl removed from one of his houses to another, Hobbes accompanied them,
even to the last of his long life. “There is a tradition in the family,” said
Bishop Kennett, in 1707, “of the manners and customs of Mr. Hobbes somewhat
observable. His professed rule of health was to dedicate the morning
to his health and the afternoon to his studies. And therefore at his first rising
he walk’d out and climb’d any hill within his reach; or, if the weather was
not dry, he fatigued himself within doors by some exercise or other to be in
a sweat; recommending that practice upon this opinion, that an old man had
more moisture than heat, and therefore by such motion heat was to be
acquired and moisture expelled. After this he took a comfortable breakfast,
and then went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl, the countess, and the
children, and any considerable strangers, paying some short address to all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
them.” ... “Towards the end of his life he had very few books, and those
he read but very little, thinking he was now only to digest what formerly he
had fed upon. If company came to visit him, he would be free in discourse
till he was pressed or contradicted, and then he had the infirmities of being
short and peevish, and referring to his writings for better satisfaction. His
friends, who had the liberty of introducing strangers to him, made these terms
with them before their admission&mdash;that they should not dispute with the old
man, nor contradict him.”</p>

<p>Thus lived Hobbes, whether at Hardwick or at Chatsworth, and thus were
all his foibles kindly looked upon and administered to, and his life made
happy by allowing him in everything&mdash;even his attendance on worship in the
private chapel, and his leaving before the sermon&mdash;to have, literally, “his own
way.” In December, 1679, the earl and countess went from Chatsworth to
Hardwick Hall, probably with the intention of keeping up their Christmas
festivities there, and even at that time the old man&mdash;for he was ninety-one
years of age&mdash;would accompany them. “He could not endure to be left in
an empty house, and whenever the earl removed he would go along with
him, even to his last stage from Chatsworth to Hardwick; when in a
very weak condition he dared not be left behind, but made his way upon
a feather bed in a coach, though he survived the journey but a few days.
He could not bear any discourse of death, and seemed to cast off all
thoughts of it. He delighted to reckon upon long life. The winter before
he died he had made a warmer coat, which he said must last him three
years, and then he would have such another. In his last sickness his
frequent questions were whether his disease was curable; and when intimations
were given that he might have ease, but no remedy, he used this
expression:&mdash;‘I shall be glad then to find a hole to creep out of the world
at;’ which are reported to have been his last sensible words, and his lying
some days following in a silent stupefaction did seem owing to his mind more
than to his body. The only thought of death that he appeared to entertain
in time of health was to take care of some inscription on his grave. He
would suffer some friends to dictate an epitaph, among which he was best
pleased with this honour, ‘<i>This is the true philosopher’s stone</i>;’ which, indeed,”
adds the bishop, “would have had as much religion in it as that which now
remains,” and of which we have just given a copy.</p>

<p>As we have already remarked, it is not our business to discuss the political
or philosophical principles which Hobbes expressed in his writings: these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
both in and after his time, were the subject of much controversy. We may,
however, remark that it was well for those who were committed to his tutelage
and close companionship, that their minds do not seem to have been corrupted
by his avowed rejection, not only of the Christian faith, but apparently of any
faith at all in the existence of a Deity. Nowhere&mdash;and he had abundance of
opportunity in some, at least, of his voluminous writings&mdash;does he show any
glimmering even of religious belief; and the history of his latest years, and
the last expression which proceeded from his mouth, testify to his fear of
death, and his dislike to have the subject mentioned in his hearing. A mere
materialist would not thus have been “subject to bondage,” inasmuch as the
conviction of utter annihilation must remove all ground of apprehension
regarding the “something after death.” Hobbes closed his eyes a resolute
doubter, if not an actual disbeliever; and no ray of comfort or of hope came
to brighten his last moments as he passed into the world of spirits to exchange
uncertainty for certainty, the mortal for the immortal.</p>

<p>The late Sir William Molesworth endeavoured to rekindle some interest in
Hobbes’s writings by republishing an edition of his works: happily, the
attempt was a failure, so far, we believe, as to any extensive sale of the poison
contained in them.</p>

<p>Externally, Hault Hucknall Church, although highly picturesque and
venerable in appearance, presents not many striking features. The tower,
which stands between nave and chancel, was probably terminated by a spire&mdash;the
upper remaining part being of much later date than the lower.</p>

<p>We have thus described the seat, next in importance to that of Chatsworth,
of the long-descended and long-ennobled family of Cavendish. Their principal
residence, Chatsworth, we describe and illustrate in another part of this
volume.</p>

<p class="dc13">ARUNDEL castle takes high rank among the
“Stately Homes of England.” Some of its more
prominent features we present to our readers. Of
very remote antiquity&mdash;for it traces back to a
period long anterior to the Conquest; deeply interesting
in its historical associations&mdash;for it has
played a leading part in the principal events of the
kingdom; and of great importance in its family
connections&mdash;for a long line of noble and illustrious
names, from the reign of Alfred the Great to our
own time, are associated with its history&mdash;Arundel
stands, a proud monument of England’s greatness,
and of the beauty of England’s fair domains.</p>

<p>The manor of Arundel was, it is stated, given in
the will of Alfred the Great (“Æthelme mines
brother suna thone ham æt Ealdingburnam, &amp; æt Cumtune, &amp; æt
Crundellan, &amp; æt Beadingum, &amp; æt Beadingahamme, &amp; æt Burnham,
&amp; æt Thunresfelda, &amp; æt Æscengum”) to his nephew, Æthelm,
the son of his brother. To Earl Godwine, and to King Harold, it
is also stated successively to have passed. At the time of the
Norman Conquest the possessions and the earldoms of Arundel,
Chichester, and Shrewsbury, were given to Roger de Montgomery, a relative
of the Conqueror, and “one of the council which formed the invasion of
England, leading the centre of the army in that famous battle of Battle
Abbey, wherein the crown accrued to the Norman.” He commanded the
entire army of archers and light infantry in the decisive battle; and to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
superior skill in military tactics was principally owing the successful issue.
To requite him for his valuable services, and place him in a position of
advantage, the Conqueror established him at Arundel in all the magnificence of
the age. Of his immense possessions, those by which he was immediately
surrounded constituted three lordships, ten hundreds and their courts and
suits of service, eighteen parks, and seventy-seven manors. He took a
prominent part in affairs of state, both in the reign of the Conqueror and in
that of William Rufus, and at last entered the monastery at Shrewsbury,
which he had founded, and where he died. He was succeeded in his possessions
in Normandy by his eldest son, Robert, Comte de Belesme, and in his
English earldoms and possessions by his youngest son, Hugh, who led a
turbulent life, and met with a premature death at Anglesey, in repulsing the
descent made by Magnus, King of Norway, on that island; he was shot from
his horse by an arrow, which pierced through his brain.</p>

<p>On the death of Hugh, his elder brother, Robert, came over from Normandy
to claim the earldoms and inheritance, to which, on paying a heavy fine, he
succeeded. “He was a cruel, crafty, and subtle man, but powerful in arms,
and eloquent in speech, and for fifteen years seldom out of rebellion; till at
length peace being made between the king and his competitor, he was called
to account for all his actions, but shifted away and fortified his castles, which
the king (Henry I.) besieged, and forced him to sue for clemency, which
was granted; but all his possessions were seized, and himself banished.”
He ultimately died in Warwick Castle&mdash;the earldoms reverting to the crown.</p>

<p>Before tracing the descent to a later time, a word on the derivation of the
name Arundel may not be out of place. It has been conjectured to be derived
from various sources. Thus, Hirundelle, from <i>Hirundo</i>, a swallow; from the
name of a famous horse, <i>Hirondelle</i>, which was the favourite of its owner, one
Sir Bevis, who is said to have been warder or constable of the castle; from
<i>Arundo</i>, a reed, which grows in the river; from <i>Portus Adurni</i>; and from
<i>Arun</i>, the name of the river, and <i>dell</i>, from the valley along which it flows;
as well as from <i>araf</i> and <i>del</i>, and other sources.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The estates and earldom having reverted to the crown under Henry I.,
were settled upon that monarch’s second wife, Adeliza, daughter of the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
of Lorraine, who married, for her second husband, William de Albini (son of
William de Albini, surnamed Pincerna, who came over with the Conqueror),
who is said to have been called “William of the Stronghand,” because, when
cast into a lion’s den&mdash;so the story goes, in consequence of his refusal to
marry the Queen of France&mdash;he seized the lion, thrust his hand into its
mouth, and down his throat, and tore out its heart! He was Lord of Buckenham,
and one of the most powerful of the barons. In the troublous reign of
Stephen, Albini and his royal wife lived at Arundel Castle, and here received
the Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I. by his first wife, and mother of
Henry II., who, with her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, and a retinue of
knights and retainers, remained there for some time. Stephen, on news
reaching him of the presence of his rival, the Empress, drew his forces to
Arundel, and laid close siege to the castle. Albini, however, not only preserved
his royal guest from violence, but by good generalship or caution,
secured for her a safe conduct to Bristol, from which she took ship, and
returned to the Continent. Albini was, subsequently, the meditator between
Stephen and the son of Queen Matilda, Henry, afterwards Henry II., by
which the crown was secured to that prince and his heirs, and so brought
about a happy peace. For his loyalty and good services he was, by Henry II.,
confirmed in the estates and titles he had enjoyed through his wife Queen
Adeliza, and was, in addition to the earldoms of Arundel and Chichester,
created Earl of Sussex. Besides taking a very prominent part in most affairs
of the nation, Albini was one of the deputation to the Pope in the matter of
the king’s dispute with A’Beckett; was sent to conduct the daughter of
Matilda into Germany on her marriage with the Duke of Saxony; was one of
the king’s trustees to the treaty of the marriage of Prince John to the
daughter of the Count of Savoy; and commanded the royal forces against the
rebellious princes, taking prisoners the Earl of Leicester, and his countess,
and all the retinue of knights. He and his wife founded the Priory of Calceto,
near Arundel; built the Abbey of Buckenham; endowed prebends in Winchester;
founded the Priory of Pynham, near Arundel; and the Chapel of
St. Thomas at Wymondham. This earl having, in conjunction with his wife,
founded the Priory of Calceto, near Arundel, granted its priors many privileges:
among which were an annual allowance of timber for the repairs of the bridge,
and a right of pasturage for cattle in common with the burgesses of Arundel.
At the dissolution of the monasteries, the office of bridge-warden, previously
held by the friars, devolved on the Mayor of Arundel, who still continues the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
office. The meadows were retained in the possession of the burgesses, and
are still held by them. He died in 1176, and was succeeded by his eldest
son (or grandson), William de Albini, who married Maud, widow of the Earl
of Clare, by whom he had issue, two sons, William and Hugh, and six
daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, William, who, dying without
issue, was succeeded by his brother, Hugh de Albini, the youngest son, who
married Isabel, daughter to the Earl of Warren and Surrey, but died without
issue. The estates then passed to his sisters and co-heiresses; that of
Arundel descending to John Fitzalan, son of the second sister of Hugh
de Albini, by her husband, John Fitzalan, Baron of Clun and Oswestry.</p>

</div>

<p>He was succeeded in the earldom and estates by his son, John, who dying
two years afterwards, was succeeded by his son, Richard, then only five years
of age. That nobleman greatly improved the Castle of Arundel, and is thus
described in “the Siege of Caerlaverock:”&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Richard, the Earl of Arundel,</p>
<p class="pp7">A well-beloved and handsome knight,</p>
<p class="pp6">In crimson surcoat marked, and well</p>
<p class="pp7">With gold and rampant lion dight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">In 1302 King Edward I. was the guest of the earl, at Arundel, and at that
time created Arundel a borough, and granted the earl certain privileges, of
taxes, &amp;c., for the purpose of fortifying it. He was succeeded by his son,
Edmund Fitzalan, who, being taken prisoner by Mortimer, was beheaded at
Hereford. He was succeeded by his son, Richard Fitzalan, to whom Arundel
Castle, which had, on the execution of the last earl, been giving to the Earl of
Kent, was restored, as were also the baronies of Fitzalan, Clun, and Oswestry.
He led an active and useful life, and distinguished himself at Crescy, Vannes,
Thouars, and other places, and founded a chantry of six priests at Arundel.
He was succeeded by his son, Richard, in his titles and estates; he died on
the scaffold, in Cheapside, in 1397, the king, Richard II., being present at the
execution. Ten days afterwards, “it being bruited abroad for a miracle that
his head should be grown to his bodye againe,” the king sent, secretly, by
night, “certaine nobilitye to see his bodie taken up, that he might be certified
of the truth, which done, and perceiving that it was a fable,” he had the grave
closed up again. Through this attainder Arundel reverted to the crown, and
was given to the Duke of Exeter.</p>

<p>The earl was succeeded by his son, Thomas Fitzalan, who was, by
Henry IV., restored both in blood and in all his possessions and titles. He
held, among other important offices, those of Warden of the Cinque Ports, Constable
of Dover Castle, and Lord High Treasurer of England. He married,
in the presence of the king and queen, Beatrix, daughter of John, King of
Portugal, but died without issue, when the Arundel estate passed, by entail,
to his cousin, Sir John Fitzalan (or Arundel, as he called himself), Lord
Maltravers. His son, John, succeeded him as Baron Maltravers and Earl of
Arundel, and was created Duke of Touraine, but being wounded before
Beavois, was carried prisoner to that place, where he died, and was succeeded
by his son, Humphrey, who died a minor. The title and estates then
passed to the brother of Earl John, William Fitzalan, who, in his turn, was
succeeded by his son, Thomas, who again was succeeded by his son, William,
who died in 1543. This nobleman was succeeded in his titles and estates by
his son, Henry Fitzalan, who in the four reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI.,
Mary, and Elizabeth, led a most eventful life, holding many important offices,
and acquitted himself nobly in all. He left issue, two daughters (his only son
having died a minor in his father’s lifetime), Joan, married to Lord Lumley,
and Mary, married to Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk. But the latter lady
having died after giving birth to a son, Philip Howard, and the other, Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Lumley, having been married twenty years without issue, the earl entailed
the estates, &amp;c., on Lord and Lady Lumley for their lives, and then to Philip
Howard, the son of his sister Mary. Thus ended the Fitzalan family, and
from that time the titles and estates have belonged to the ducal family of
Howard.</p>

<p>Philip Howard, so christened after Philip I., of Spain, one of his godfathers,
was only son by his first wife, Mary, daughter of the Earl of Arundel, of
Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, who was beheaded for high treason in
1572. The title of Duke of Norfolk being lost by his attainder, Philip
Howard did not enjoy it, but was Earl of Arundel and Surrey. He was also
unjustly attainted, was tried for high treason, sentenced for execution, but
ultimately died, during his imprisonment, in the Tower. This ill-fated young
nobleman had married Anne, daughter and heiress of Lord Dacres of Gillesland,
by whom he had an only child, born after he was cast into prison, and
who succeeded him. This was Thomas Howard, the celebrated Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Arundel and Surrey (and afterwards Earl of Norfolk), whose brilliant career
and high attainments are matters of history. His lordship, who is so well
known as the founder of the collection of marbles, &amp;c., married the Lady
Alathea Talbot, daughter and one of the co-heiresses of Gilbert Talbot, Earl
of Shrewsbury, by whom he had issue, Henry Frederick, Lord Mowbray and
Maltravers (who succeeded him), Sir William Howard, ancestor of the Earls
of Stafford, and James, Thomas, Gilbert, and Charles, who all died unmarried.</p>

<p>Henry Frederick, the eldest son, who, during his father’s lifetime, had been
called to the Upper House by the title of Baron Mowbray and Maltravers,
married the Lady Elizabeth Stuart, eldest daughter of the Duke of Lennox,
of the blood royal, for which, for a time, he incurred the displeasure of his
Majesty, and, with his lady, was placed in confinement. He had issue, ten
sons and three daughters. These sons were, Thomas, who succeeded him;
Henry; Philip, who became a cardinal, and was variously styled Cardinal of
Norfolk and Cardinal of England; Charles, who married Mary Tattershall and
founded the Greystocke line; Talbot, Edward, and Francis, who died unmarried;
Bernard, who married Catherine Tattershall; and two others.</p>

<p>Thomas Howard, who succeeded his father as Earl of Arundel, Surrey,
and Norfolk, &amp;c., had restored to him, and to the heirs male of himself and
his father, the dukedom of Norfolk and all the honours belonging to that title.
He thus became fifth Duke of Norfolk, a title which has continued without
further interruption till the present time. He died unmarried in 1677, when
the title and estates passed to his brother Henry, sixth Duke of Norfolk, who
had been previously created a peer by the title of Baron Howard of Castle
Rising, Earl of Norwich, and Earl Marshal of England. He married, first,
Lady Anne Somerset, daughter of the Marquis of Worcester, and by her had
issue, two sons and three daughters; and secondly, Grace Bickerton, by whom
he had three sons and three daughters. Dying in 1684, he was succeeded by
his eldest son, Henry Howard (who had been summoned to Parliament in his
father’s lifetime as Baron Mowbray), as seventh Duke of Norfolk, who was
one of the supporters of the Prince of Orange. He married the Lady Mary
Mordaunt, daughter of the Earl of Peterborough, from whom he was divorced
in 1700, but died without issue in 1701, when the title and estates passed to
his nephew&mdash;</p>

<p>Thomas, eighth Duke of Norfolk, who married Mary, daughter of Sir
Nicholas Sherburn, by whom he had no issue; and dying in 1732, was succeeded,
as ninth Duke of Norfolk, by his brother Edward, who married, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
1727, Mary Blount, but died without issue in 1777, at the age of ninety-one.
The titles and estates then passed to a distant member of the family, his third
cousin, Charles Howard, of the Greystocke family, who thus became tenth
Duke of Norfolk. He married Catherine, daughter of John Brocholes, Esq.,
and by her had issue, besides a daughter who died young, one son, Charles,
who succeeded him, as eleventh Duke of Norfolk, in 1786.</p>

<p>This nobleman, who was the restorer, or rebuilder, of Arundel Castle&mdash;a
man of considerable literary and scientific attainments&mdash;married, first, Mary
Anne Copinger, and second, Frances Scudamore, but had no issue by either.
He was succeeded by his relative, Bernard Edward Howard, as twelfth Duke
of Norfolk, who, marrying the Lady Elizabeth Belasyse, daughter of Earl
Faulconberg (from whom he was divorced), had an only son, Henry Charles,
who succeeded him in 1842.</p>

<p>Henry Charles, thirteenth duke, who was born in 1791, married, in 1814,
the Lady Charlotte Leveson Gower, daughter of the Duke of Sutherland (she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
is still living), by whom he had issue, Henry Granville, Earl of Surrey, who
succeeded him; Lord Edward George Fitzalan Howard, of Glossop Hall,
Derbyshire, created, 1869, “Baron Howard, of Glossop;” Lord Bernard
Thomas; and the Ladies Mary Charlotte and Adeliza Matilda. His Grace
died in 1856, and was succeeded as fourteenth duke by his eldest son, Henry
Granville Fitzalan-Howard (who had assumed, by royal sign-manual, in 1842,
the surname of Fitzalan before that of Howard). He married, in 1839,
Augusta Mary Minna Catherine, daughter of the first Baron Lyons (she still
survives), by whom he had issue, two sons, viz., Henry Fitzalan-Howard,
the present Duke of Norfolk, and Lord Edward Bernard Fitzalan-Howard;
and seven daughters, viz., the Lady Victoria Alexandrina, born 1840,
and married in 1861 to James Robert Hope-Scott, Esq., Q.C.; the Lady
Minna Charlotte, born 1843; the Lady Mary Adeliza, born 1845; the
Lady Ethelreda, born 1849; the Lady Philippa, born 1852; the Lady
Anne, born 1857; and the Lady Margaret, born 1860. During the life
of this nobleman, who was universally beloved and respected, her Majesty
Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort paid a visit of three days to
Arundel Castle, where the reception was kept up with regal magnificence.
His Grace died in 1860, and was succeeded by his eldest son, then in his
thirteenth year.</p>

<p>The present peer, his Grace Henry Fitzalan-Howard, fifteenth Duke of
Norfolk, Earl of Arundel, Earl of Surrey, Earl of Norfolk, Baron Maltravers,
Baron Fitzalan, Baron Clun, Baron Oswestry, Premier Duke and Earl next to
the blood royal, Hereditary Earl Marshal, and Chief Butler of England, was
born on the 27th of December, 1847, and attained his majority in 1868. His
grace is unmarried. He is the patron of seven livings; but, “being a Roman
Catholic, cannot present.”</p>

<p>The arms of the Duke of Norfolk are&mdash;Quarterly: first, <i>gules</i>, on a bend
between six cross-crosslets, fitchée, <i>argent</i>, an escutcheon, <i>or</i>, charged with
a demi-lion rampant, pierced through the mouth with an arrow, within a
double tressure, flory counter-flory, all <i>gules</i>, for Howard; second, the arms
of England (<i>gules</i>, three lions passant guardant, <i>or</i>), charged with a label of
three points, <i>argent</i>, for difference, for Plantagenet; third, chequy, <i>or</i> and

at each end, <i>sable</i>. Supporters:&mdash;on the dexter side a lion, <i>argent</i>, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
sinister, a horse of the same, holding in his mouth a slip of oak, fructed, <i>proper</i>.
The motto is “Sola Virtus Invicta.”</p>

<p>Thus having briefly traced the history of the house of Howard, so far as
the main line connected with Arundel Castle is concerned, we turn our
attention to some of the many beauties and attractions of the domain of
Arundel.</p>

<p>In situation, as a fortress, few sites were so well chosen as that of Arundel
Castle. At the southern extremity of the elevated platform on which it
stands a strong wall enclosed the inner court, containing upwards of five
acres; on the north-east and south-east a precipitous dip of the hill to ninety
feet, rendered the castle inaccessible. On the remaining sides a deep <i>fosse</i>,
protected on the north by a double vallation, and cutting off all external communication
in that direction, secured the garrison from any sudden incursion
or surprise. In the centre rose the Donjon, or Keep, circular in form,
enormous in strength, crowning a lofty artificial mound, and commanding a
wide and uninterrupted view of all the neighbouring approaches. “The walls,
from eight to ten feet in thickness, enclosed a nearly circular space of more
than sixty feet in diameter, and of great height&mdash;the apartments being all lit
from the central well-staircase, and there being no loopholes in the walls.
This Keep&mdash;which still stands in all its venerable and hoary age&mdash;is supposed
to have been built by Alfred the Great, and to have been recased in Norman
times, when the present doorway was made. To the same period belongs a
portion of the tower near it, and which is connected with the Keep by a
covered passage carried across the moat. The Barbican, or Bevis’s Tower,
occupying the north-west side of the ditch surrounding the Keep, has also some
good Norman features, and it, as well as the Keep covered with luxuriant ivy,
and the old entrance, built by Fitzalan, form the most interesting and
picturesque portions of the venerable place.”</p>

<p>The entrance to the castle at the present time is at the top of High Street.
The approach is enclosed by embattled walls with turrets, and the entrance
gateway, surmounted by a portcullis and the arms of Howard, is between two
massive embattled towers: of this gateway we give an engraving, taken from
the interior. Following the carriage-way, the visitor arrives at the entrance
to the grand quadrangle, a massive and lofty arched gateway flanked by two
towers. Passing through this gateway the appearance of the castle is grand
and imposing. On the right of the gateway is the <span class="smcap">Chapel</span>, and adjoining it
is the <span class="smcap">Baron’s Hall</span>, or Banqueting Chamber; on the south side is the grand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
or state entrance; and in the north-east wing is the Library, &amp;c. None of
these buildings, however, are of ancient times.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-163.jpg" width="400" height="314" id="a163"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Library.</i></p>
</div>

<p>One of the first objects that will be noticed by the visitor is a bas-relief,
which occupies a large space in the front wall of the <span class="smcap">Alfred Saloon</span>, next to
the Great Library. It represents Alfred the Great instituting, or founding,
trial by jury&mdash;the king himself standing in the centre surrounded by his
nobles and people, and delivering a scroll, which he holds in his hand, bearing
the words, in Saxon characters, “That man fiœbe gemot on cum Wapentace”
(That man, in every hundred (Wapentake), shall find twelve jury). It
was designed by Rossi, a sculptor of modern time.</p>

<p>The castle is entered from this quadrangle or court-yard, by the grand
entrance, or state entrance, as it is called. This is a fine modern doorway, of
Norman design, in a machicolated central tower of three stories in height.
Over the doorway is a large central window, on each side of which is a
colossal figure of Hospitality and Liberty respectively. Over this again are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
arms of the Howards, sculptured, and these again are surmounted by the machicolations,
parapet, &amp;c. Immediately on entering this splendid ducal residence,
the visitor reaches the <span class="smcap">Grand-staircase</span> leading to its various apartments.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Baron’s Hall</span>, or <span class="smcap">Banqueting Chamber</span>, is a remarkably fine, and
even gorgeous, apartment. “Its architecture, like that of the chapel, is in
the style of the fourteenth century. It is 71 feet in length, by 35 in
breadth, lofty in proportion, and, as a whole, produces a striking effect on
the spectator.” The roof is of Spanish chestnut, elaborately carved, and the
sculptures around the walls and on the windows are of elegant design. The
stained-glass windows are, however, “the grand attraction, for in these the
story of English freedom is brilliantly told. They are thirteen in number.
The great window illustrates the ratification of the great charter by King
John, who seems to pause in the act of affixing his signature to the instrument.”
Behind him are several prelates, while to his right are the Pope’s
Legate and the Archbishop of Dublin, and, to his left, Cardinal Langton.
There are also Baron Fitzwalter, the Master of the Knights Templars, the
Lord Mayor, and others. In the other windows, which were superbly executed
by Eginton, one of the best of our artists in stained glass, are full-length
figures of eight barons of the Norfolk family, who aided in procuring the
charter&mdash;the heads, however, as well as those in the large window, being
portraits of members of the Howard family of the beginning of the present
century, at which time the windows were executed. On the walls are several
fine suits of armour, &amp;c. This magnificent hall was first opened on the 15th
of June, 1815, being the 600th anniversary of the signing of the charter.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Drawing-Room</span> is a noble apartment, commanding a magnificent
and extensive view of the valley of the Arun, and the surrounding country.
In it is a large collection of family portraits, among which are Thomas
Howard, Earl of Surrey, vindicating himself (“Sire, he was my crowned king.
If the authority of Parliament had placed the crown on that stake, I would
have fought for it. Let it place it on your head and you will find me as ready
in your defence”) before Henry VII. for the part he took at the battle of
Bosworth field; John, Duke of Norfolk, who fell at Bosworth, and who is
generally known as “Jocky of Norfolk,” from the rude couplet:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Jocky of Norfolk, be not too bold,<br />
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold”&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">which was found written on his gate, as a warning, on the morning when he
set out on his fatal expedition; Henry, Earl of Surrey, the great poet of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
age, “who was not only the ornament of the court of Henry VIII., which he
attended in the capacity of companion to the Duke of Richmond, but of the
still more brilliant and chivalrous court of Francis I. His travels on the
Continent were those of a scholar and knight-errant; and the vision which he
had in Agrippa’s magic mirror of his lady-love, the ‘Fair Geraldine,’ whom he
has so nobly perpetuated in verse, excited in him such a transport of enthusiasm,
that, at a tournament in Florence, he challenged all who could handle
a lance&mdash;Turk, Saracen, or cannibal&mdash;to dispute against him her claims to the
supremacy of beauty, and came off victorious: but the well-known hatred of
the tyrant Henry to all the Howards prematurely extinguished this bright
promise of excellence, and Surrey, the last victim of the royal murderer,
perished on the scaffold at the early age of twenty-seven:”&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Who has not heard of Surrey’s fame?<br />
His was the hero’s soul of fire,<br />
And his the bard’s immortal name.”</p>

<p class="p1">In 1547, he was beheaded on Tower Hill. One of the dark blots on British
history, was the execution of this true hero of the pen and sword. The
portraits also include those of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk (by Holbein), who
was beheaded, and his wife, Mary Fitzalan; Henry Fitzalan; Cardinal
Howard; “Belted Will Howard,” of whom we shall speak in our
account of Castle Howard; and various other members of this distinguished
family.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Dining-Room</span>, formed out of the ancient family chapel, is principally
remarkable for its large stained-glass window, the subject of which is the
meeting of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba&mdash;the heads being portraits
of the twelfth duke and his duchess. On each side is respectively the mercy-seat
in the tabernacle, and the interior of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Library</span>, the building of which was commenced in 1801, is an apartment
of much magnificence. The book-cases and reading-galleries are supported
by fifteen columns, wrought out of the richest Spanish mahogany;
while the spidered roof displays a beauty of workmanship and delicacy of
carving, enriched with fruit-foliage, which have seldom been surpassed. It is
divided into several compartments for reading recesses, and communicates with
the <span class="smcap">Alfred Saloon</span> by folded doors.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chapel</span> adjoins the Baron’s Hall, and is a chaste and beautiful
apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary further to describe the interior of the castle;
but it will be well to note that a chamber over the inner gateway enjoys
the traditionary fame of having been the sleeping-place of the Empress
Matilda. It is a low square apartment, and contains a bedstead which
the queen is said to have occupied; but, unfortunately for the charm of
the tradition, it is some centuries later in date than the time in which she
lived.</p>

<p>Under the east end of the castle is a large vault, upwards of 60 feet in
length, the massive walls of which are formed of blocks of chalk, strengthened
with ribs of stone, and are of about 7 feet in thickness. This vault was used,
of course, as a place of safety for prisoners, and a curious instance of escape
from it is recorded. It seems that in the year 1404 one John Mot was here
confined on a charge of robbery, but contrived to make his escape. Before he
could get clear away, his flight was discovered, and he was followed. Finding
himself closely pursued, he suddenly turned to the College of the Holy Trinity,
and seizing the ring attached to the gate just as his captors were about to lay
hands on him, claimed the right of sanctuary. He was, however, forcibly
seized, and carried back to prison. Knowledge of the affair reaching the ears
of the priests, two of the parties who assisted the constable in making the
seizure of Mot were summoned before the bishop, found guilty, and “ordered
to make a pilgrimage on foot to the shrine of St. Richard at Chichester, to
present an offering there according to their ability, to be cudgelled (<i>fustigati</i>)
five times through the church of Arundel, and five times to recite the paternoster,
ave, and creed, upon their knees before the crucifix of the high altar.”
Before the sentence, however, could be carried into execution, the prisoner
was wisely restored to the church, the cudgelling was remitted, and offerings
of burning tapers were substituted.</p>

<p>A word may be said about the fine old horned owls that at one time gave
renown to the Keep&mdash;owls of a peculiar breed, and about whom many curious
anecdotes have been related. At present, however, they greet the visitors
under glass, in cases; but it is understood that some of their progeny are
preparing to take the places in life of the old denizens of the time-honoured
ruin.</p>

<p>It will be seen that all the inhabited portions of Arundel Castle are of
comparatively recent date; they are fitted up with much judgment and
taste, but by no means gorgeously. In one of the lesser chambers are
hung some modern drawings of great merit and value, by Prout, Hunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Copley Fielding, David Cox, and other artists of the best days of the British
school.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Keep</span> is the great attraction of the castle and domain of Arundel.
Though now but a picturesque ruin, it has been prominent in all the internal
contests of the kingdom, from the days of Alfred the Great to the reign of the
third William. To this relic of a remote age the public are freely admitted;
and a courteous custodier is always at hand to detail its history, and conduct
through its winding and tortuous paths from base to summit.</p>

<p>Dating from a time certainly anterior to the Conquest, before the application
of “villainous saltpetre,” it must have been impregnable&mdash;commanding
the adjacent country on all sides, and rendering the Arun a mere tributary to
the will of its lords; it had a large share in controlling the destinies of the
kingdom during the several civil wars to which it had been subjected. It
remains one of the most picturesque of the ruins that in England recall the
memories of battles lost and won, of glories continually claimed and resigned
by rival competitors, and of heroes whose mortal parts have been dust from
ages so remote that their records are read only in “the dim twilight of
tradition.”</p>

<p>The historian, Tierney, states that the Keep probably comprised the principal
feature of the Saxon stronghold. It is of a circular formation, and of
immense strength. The height from the bottom of the fosse, on the external
side, was 70 feet; on the internal, 69; which, with walls and battlements,
produced an elevation altogether of 96 feet on the east; 103 on the west.
The walls varied from 8 to 10 feet, strengthened by ribs and buttresses. The
inner space, which is circular, afforded accommodation to the garrison; in
extent it varied from 59 to 67 feet in diameter. In the interior were several
chambers, converging towards a subterraneous room in the centre. Differing
from other Keeps, it contained no openings or loopholes from which the enemy
could be annoyed, and it was only from the ramparts and battlements that the
garrison could repel the assaults of the assailant. No traces can be seen of
the original Saxon entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Connected with the Keep is, of course, the Well-tower. Bevis’s Tower, the
Barbican, is seen immediately underneath, while, at a short distance, is “the
Chapel of St. Mary, over the gate.”</p>

<p>The square building, known as the Clock Tower (introduced in the
engraving), and through which a vaulted Norman passage leads to the Keep,
dates from a period not long after the Conquest; parts of it bear unequivocal
marks of so early an origin. The upper portion of the building has been
renovated; but the lower portion remains almost as perfect as when completed,
as it is said to have been, by the first Earl of Arundel. “The passage
abutted to the fosse, and was defended by a portcullis and drawbridge.” A
window is pointed out from which, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1139, the Empress Maud, it is said,
“scolded” the King, Stephen, who besieged the castle in which she was a
guest.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Church of St. Martin</span> forms a portion of the Keep, and some relics
of the ancient and venerable structure yet endure. It was the oratory of the
garrison, and is “mentioned in Domesday Book as enjoying an annual rent of
twelve pence, payable by one of the burgesses of Arundel.” From a window
of an early date is obtained a view of the castle immediately beneath; but the
prospect of the adjacent country is very beautiful, not only of the fertile land
and bountiful river, but of the far-off sea; and hours may be pleasantly and
profitably spent on this mount that time has hallowed. In bidding the
pleasant theme farewell, we cannot do better than quote the old rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Since William rose, and Harold fell,<br />
There have been counts of Arundel;<br />
And earls old Arundel shall have,<br />
While rivers flow and forests wave.”</p>

<p class="p1">It is scarcely necessary to add that the grounds and park are worthy of
the castle; they are especially beautiful, varied in hill and dale&mdash;the free
river at their base&mdash;full of magnificently grown trees, and comprise eleven
hundred acres, well stocked with deer.</p>

<p>In the park, which was originally the hunting forest of the old Earls of
Arundel, will be noticed Hiorn’s Tower&mdash;a triangular, turreted building, of
about 50 feet in height, and designed as a prospect tower by the architect
whose name it bears. Near to it is Pugh-Dean, where, it is said, Bevis, the
Great Castellan of Arundel, and his famous horse, “Hirondelle,” are buried.
A mound, covered with a clump of Scotch fir-trees, is pointed out as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
burial-place. Near this place, too, is the site of the old chapel and hermitage
of St. James.</p>

<p>The old bridge over the river Arun was situated a short distance below the
present structure. It is first mentioned in the charter which Queen Adeliza
granted to the monks of the Priory de Calceto, in which lands for their
support, and an allowance of timber for repairs of the bridge, were granted.
It was entirely rebuilt in 1724, principally of stone taken from the ruins of the
adjoining hospital. In 1831 it was widened and improved.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Church of the Holy Trinity, Arundel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Church of the Holy Trinity</span>. All that remains of this once famous
establishment is a square building “enclosing a square yard, partly occupied
by cloisters, and partly devoted to other purposes of a monastic establishment.”
In it are some splendid monuments to members of the noble families who have
owned the place. One of the principal is that of Thomas, Earl of Arundel,
and his countess, Beatrix, daughter of John, King of Portugal; and another
striking feature is a canopied tomb near the altar.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Church</span> possesses many highly interesting features, and forms a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
pleasing object in the landscape, from whichever side it is seen. It is cruciform,
and consists of a nave with side aisles, a chancel, and transept; and in
the centre rises a low tower, surmounted by a diminutive spire.</p>

<p>The original ecclesiastical foundation was that of the alien priory, or cell,
dedicated to St. Nicholas, established by Roger de Montgomery, Earl of
Arundel, soon after the Conquest, and subjected to the Benedictine Abbey of
Seez, or de Sagio, in Normandy. It consisted only of a prior and three or
four monks, who continued to conduct the establishment for nearly three
centuries, until the third year of the reign of Richard II., when Richard
Fitzalan obtained a licence to extinguish the priory and to found a chantry
for the maintenance of a master and twelve secular canons with their officers.
Upon this change, it was styled “the Church of the Holy Trinity.” At the
suppression, it was endowed with a yearly revenue of £263 14<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Being intended as the mausoleum of his family, the founder supplied ample
means to enrich it with examples of monumental splendour. The tomb of his
son, Thomas Fitzalan, and his wife, Beatrix, daughter of John, King of
Portugal, was the earliest of those placed in the church. It is of alabaster,
finely sculptured, and was formerly painted and gilt. It contains the effigies
of the earl and his lady; at the feet of the earl is a horse, the cognizance of
the Fitzalans; and at those of his lady are two lap-dogs. Around, in niches,
are small standing figures of ecclesiastics, or pleureurs, with open books, as
performing funeral obsequies; and above them as many escutcheons. Other
stately tombs are erected to the memory of John Fitzalan and his wife, and
Thomas Arundel and his wife, “one of the eyres of Richard Woodevyle,
Earl Rivers, sister to Elizabeth, Queen of England, sometime wife to King
Edward IV.”</p>

<p>The chapel which contains these monuments is still in a dilapidated state,
as was the whole church&mdash;“ruinated” during the temporary possession of the
Iconoclasts of the Commonwealth&mdash;until Henry Charles, Duke of Norfolk,
restored it, and put upon it a roof, which it had long been without.</p>

<p>Visitors to Arundel will note near the bridge some ancient ruins. According
to the historian, Tierney, they are the remains of the <i>Maison Dieu</i>, that
owed its origin to the same munificence as the collegiate chapel and church.
It formed a quadrangle, which was occupied by the chapel, refectory, and its
offices, and the various chambers. There was a cloister round the court-yard.
Quoting the statutes, “the establishment,” says Mr. Tierney, “was to consist
of twenty poor men, either unmarried or widowers, who, from age, sickness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
or infirmity, were unable to provide for their own sustenance. They were to
be selected from among the most deserving of the surrounding neighbourhood,
giving the preference only to the servants or tenants of the founder and his
heirs; they were to be men of moral lives and edifying conversation, and were
required, as a qualification for their admission, to know the ‘Pater Noster,’
the ‘Ave-Maria,’ and the ‘Credo,’ in Latin.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Tombs of Thomas Fitzalan and Lady Beatrix, Arundel Church.</i></p>
</div>

<p>These buildings were dismantled at the time of the dissolution of the
monasteries, and no doubt suffered much at the time of the siege and sack of
Arundel, during the Civil War, by the Parliamentarians under the command of
Sir William Waller; in 1724 a large quantity of the materials was used in the
building of the bridge, that portion only being rescued which is now seen, and
which has been preserved by the Duke of Norfolk because of the interest
attached to the once sacred structure.</p>

<p>Arundel, with its many attractions, is barely two hours distant from
London, and within half an hour of populous Brighton; yet visits of strangers
to the old town and venerable castle are comparatively few.</p>

<p class="dc13">PENSHURST&mdash;the “Home” of the Sidneys&mdash;the
stately Sidneys: stately in their character, in
their careers, in their patriotism, in their
heroism, in their rectitude, and in their verse&mdash;is
surely one of the best of the Stately
Homes of England to be included in our
series. The very name of Penshurst seems
to call up associations of no ordinary character
connected with that heroic race, and with
many of the most stirring incidents of British
history. With Penshurst every great name
memorable in the Augustan age of England
is linked for ever; while its venerable aspect,
the solemnity of the surrounding shades, the
primitive character of its vicinity, together with its isolated position&mdash;away
from the haunts of busy men&mdash;are in harmony with the memories it awakens.</p>

<p>Here lived the earliest and bravest of the Anglo-Norman knights. Here
dwelt the ill-fated Bohuns&mdash;the three unhappy Dukes of Buckingham, who
perished in succession, one in the field and two on the scaffold. And here
flourished the Sidneys! Here, during his few brief years of absence from
turmoil in the turbulent countries of Ireland and Wales, resided the elder
Sidney, Sir Henry, who, although his fame has been eclipsed by the more
dazzling reputation of his gallant son, was in all respects good as well as
great&mdash;a good soldier, a good subject, a good master, and a good counsellor
and actor under circumstances peculiarly perilous. This is the birthplace of
“the darling of his time,” the “chiefest jewel of a crown,” the “diamond of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the court of Queen Elizabeth.” Here, too, was born&mdash;and here was interred
the mutilated body of&mdash;the “later Sidney:” he who had “set up Marcus
Brutus for his pattern,” and perished on the scaffold&mdash;a martyr for the “good
old cause,” one of the many victims of the meanest and most worthless of his
race. With the memories of these three marvellous men&mdash;the Sidneys, Henry,
Philip, and Algernon&mdash;are closely blended those of the worthies of the two
most remarkable eras in English history. Who can speak of Penshurst
without thinking of Spenser,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">(“For Sidney heard him sing, and knew his voice,”)</p>

</div>

<p>The history of the descent of Penshurst to the Sidneys may be summed up
in few words&mdash;that of the Sidneys themselves will require greater space. It
was “the ancient seat of the Pencestres, or Penchesters, who settled here in
Norman times,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and one of whom was Sir Stephen, that famous Lord Warden
of the Five Ports, and Constable of Dover Castle, who flourished in the reigns
of Henry III. and Edward I., and who was a very learned man, and ordered
all the muniments, grants, &amp;c., relating to Dover Castle to be written in a fair
book, which he called <i>Castelli Feodarium</i>, and out of which Darell composed
the history of that fortress.” Dying without male issue, his estates were
divided between his two daughters and co-heiresses, Joan, wife of Henry
Cobham, and Alice, wife of John de Columbers, to the latter of whom fell
Penshurst, &amp;c., which was soon afterwards conveyed to Sir John de Poultney,
who (15th Edward II.) had license to embattle his mansion houses at Penshurst
and elsewhere. He was four times Lord Mayor of London, and, dying,
his widow “married Lovaines, and conveyed these estates into that family
with consent of her first husband’s immediate heirs;” and they afterwards
passed, by an heiress, to Sir Philip St. Clere, whose son sold them to the
Regent Duke of Bedford. On his decease in Paris in the reign of Henry VI.,
Penshurst and other manors passed to his next brother, Humphrey, the “good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Duke of Gloucester,” after whose sad death, in 1447, they reverted to the
crown, and were, in that same year, granted to the Staffords. On the
attainder of Edward, Duke of Buckingham, Penshurst reverted to the Crown.</p>

<p>That brilliant nobleman&mdash;whose principal crimes were his wealth, his open,
manly, and generous nature, and his wise criticisms of the ruinous expenditure
on the “field of the cloth of gold”&mdash;was treacherously invited to court by the
king, and, suspecting no mischief, he obeyed the summons, and set out on his
journey from Thornbury, not observing for some time that he was closely
followed by three knights of the king’s body-guard, “and a secret power of
servants-at-arms.” His suspicions were first awakened at Windsor, where he
lodged for the night, “the same three knights lying close by,” and where he
was treated with marked disrespect by the king’s gentleman harbinger. From
Windsor, Buckingham rode on to Westminster, and then took his barge to
row down to Greenwich, where the court then was, calling, however, on his
way, at York House, to see Cardinal Wolsey, who was denied to him. “Well,
yet will I drink of my lord cardinal’s wine as I pass,” said the duke: “and
then a gentleman of my lord cardinal’s brought the duke with much reverence
into the cellar, where the duke drank; but when he saw and perceived no
cheer to him was made, he changed colour, and departed.” Passing forward
down the Thames, as he neared the City, his barge was hailed and boarded
by Sir Henry Marney, captain of the body-guard, who, in the king’s name,
attached him as a traitor. He was at once carried on shore and taken
through Thames Street to the Tower, “to the great astonishment and regret
of the people, to whom he was justly endeared.” This was on the 16th of
April, 1521. On the 13th of May he was put on his mock trial and was
condemned. “I shall never sue the king for life,” said he; and he kept
his word. On the 17th he was executed, without having once supplicated
his brutal king to spare the life he was unjustly taking away. “He was as
undaunted in sight of the block as he had been before his judges; and he died
as brave men die&mdash;firmly and meekly, and without bravado.” His death was
the grief of the people. “God have mercy on his soul, for he was a most
wise and noble prince, and the mirrour of all courtesie”&mdash;that was written of
him at the time.</p>

<p>By this detestable piece of royal treachery Henry became possessed of the
estates of the duke, and held them in his own hands for several years,
enlarging Penshurst Park, and reaping benefit from his unhallowed acquisitions.
By Edward VI., Penshurst, with its appurtenances, was “granted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Sir Ralph Fane, who, within two years, was executed as an accomplice of the
Protector Somerset.”</p>

<p>Soon after this, the young monarch gave Penshurst, with other adjoining
estates, to Sir William Sidney, one of the heroes of Flodden Field, “who had
been his tutor, chamberlain, and steward of his household from his birth to
his coronation.” Thus Penshurst came into the family of the Sidneys, concerning
whom we will proceed to give some particulars.</p>

<p>The earliest member of the family of whom aught authentic is known is
Sir William Sidney, who lived in the reign of Stephen. His son, Sir Simon
(1213), married Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Delamere; and their son
again, Sir Roger (1239), married Eleanor, daughter of Sir John Sopham, by
whom he had issue two sons, Sir Henry (1268), who succeeded him, and
Simon; and a daughter, married to Sir John Wales. Sir Henry Sidney
married Maud, daughter of Robert d’Abernon, and granddaughter of Sir
John d’Abernon. By her he had issue four sons and two daughters, and
was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Henry Sidney, who, marrying a daughter
of Sir Ralph Hussey, died in 1306, and was succeeded by his son, Sir William
Sidney, who took to wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Richard Ashburnham, by
whom he had three sons, viz.: William, who married a daughter of John de
Altaripa, but died without heirs male; John, who died young; and another
John, who succeeded him, and marrying Helen, daughter of Robert Batisford,
was the father, by her, of Sir William Sidney. This Sir William took to wife
Joanna, daughter of William Brokhull, who married, first, Margaret Orre, and
second, Isabell. By his first wife he had issue two sons, John, who succeeded
him, and William (of whom presently). This John Sidney had a son John,
who married Isabell Payteuine, by whom he had an only daughter and heiress
Johanna, who married William Appesley. William Sydney, by his wife, Alicia,
daughter and heiress of John Clumford, had one son, William, and four
daughters. This William Sidney married Cicely, daughter and co-heiress of
Sir John Michell, and Margaret, his wife, who was daughter and heiress of
Matham. He was succeeded by his son, William Sidney, who married twice.
By his first wife, Isabell St. John, he had a son, William, whose line ended
in co-heiresses, married to William Vuedall and John Hampden; and by his
second wife, Thomasen, daughter and heiress of John Barrington, and widow
of Lonsford (and who, after Sidney’s death, became wife of Lord Hopton), he
had issue a son, Nicholas Sidney, who married Anne, cousin and co-heiress
of Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

     <p class="pc"><i>North and West Fronts.</i></p>
</div>

<p>By her he had a son, Sir William
Sidney, who married Anne, daughter of Hugh Pagenham, and by her had,
besides Sir Henry, who succeeded him, four daughters, viz.: Frances, who
became Countess of Sussex by her marriage to Thomas Ratcliffe, Earl of
Sussex, Viscount Fitzwalter, Lord Egremont and Burnell, Lord Chamberlain,
Knight of the Garter, and one of the Privy Council; Mary, married to Sir
William Dormer; Lucy, married to Sir James Harrington; and Anne, married
to Sir William Fitzwilliam. This Sir William Sidney was made a knight,
3rd Henry VIII., at the burning of Conquest, and a banneret on Flodden
Field, 5th Henry VIII. He was chamberlain to Prince Edward (afterwards
Edward VI.), and also steward of his household; and his wife was “governesse
of the sayd prince while he was in his nurse’s handes.” To him it was that
Penshurst was given by Edward VI. as a mark of affectionate regard. Dying
in 1553, he was succeeded by his son, Sir Henry Sidney, who was a Knight
of the Garter, Lord President of Wales, and one of the Privy Council; he
married Lady Mary, eldest daughter of John, Duke of Northumberland, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
by her had issue “the incomparable” Sir Philip, and two other sons, Robert
and Thomas, and a daughter, Mary, married to Henry Herbert, Earl of Pembroke.
This Henry Sidney was knighted, 3rd Edward VI., and was, when
only twenty-two years of age, sent by that amiable young monarch as
ambassador to the French court. Under Queen Mary he was Lord Treasurer
of Ireland, and Lord Chief Justice, and under Elizabeth was, in 1564,
made Lord President of the Council in the Marches of Wales; Knight of the
Garter in 1564; and was twice Lord Deputy of Ireland and Lord President
of Wales.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Sidney had been brought up and educated with Edward VI.,
“being companion and many times the bedfellow of the prince;” and that
young king died in his arms. This death so affected Sir Henry, “that he
returned to Penshurst to indulge his melancholy. Here he soon afterwards
sheltered the ruined family of his father-in-law, the Duke of Northumberland,
in whose fall he would in all probability have been implicated but for his
retirement.” He died at Ludlow, the seat of his government, in 1586&mdash;his
heart being there buried, but his body was interred with great solemnity, by
the queen’s order, at Penshurst. The concurring testimony of all historians
and biographers, such as Camden, Sir Richard Cox, Campian (in his “History
of Ireland”), Hollinshed, Anthony-à-Wood, and Lloyd (in his “State
Worthies”), proves the extraordinary courage, abilities, and virtue of Sir
Henry Sidney. These qualities made him the most direct and clear politician.
He seems to have been incapable of intrigue and the supple arts of the court.
“His dispatches are full, open, and manly; and Ireland, and perhaps Wales,
to this day experience the good effects of his wise government.”</p>

<p>“As the father was, so was the son;” the son being Sir Philip Sidney, to
whom we have alluded. Sir Philip was born at Penshurst, November 29th,
1554. His life was one scene of romance from its commencement to its close.
His early years were spent in travel; and on his return he was married to the
daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham, a lady of many accomplishments, and
of “extraordinary handsomeness,” but his heart was given to another. The
Lady Penelope Devereux won it, and kept it till he fell on the field of
Zutphen. Family regards had forbidden their marriage, but she was united
to the immortal part of him, and that contract has not yet been dissolved.
She is still the Philoclea of the “Arcadia,” and Stella in the poems of
“Astrophel.” It is unnecessary to follow in detail the course of Sir Philip
Sidney’s life. There is no strange inconsistency to reason off, no stain to clear,
no blame to talk away.</p>

<p>We describe it when we name his accomplishments;
we remember it as we would a dream of uninterrupted glory. His learning,
his beauty, his chivalry, his grace, shed a lustre on the most glorious reign
recorded in the English annals. England herself, “by reason of the widespread
fame of Sir Philip Sidney,” rose exalted in the eyes of foreign nations&mdash;he
was the idol, the darling of his own. For with every sort of power at his
command, it was his creed to think all vain but affection and honour, and to
hold the simplest and cheapest pleasures the truest and most precious. The
only displeasure he ever incurred at court was when he vindicated the rights
and independence of English commoners in his own gallant person against
the arrogance of English nobles in the person of the Earl of Oxford. For a
time, then, he retired from the court, and sought rest in his loved simplicity.
He went to Wilton; and there, for the amusement of his dear sister, Mary,
Countess of Pembroke, he wrote, between the years 1579 and 1581, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
“Arcadia,” a work whose strange fortune it has been to be too highly valued
in one age, and far too underrated in another. Immediately after its publication
it was received with unbounded applause. “From it was taken the
language of compliment and love; it gave a tinge of similitude to the colloquial
and courtly dialect of the time; and from thence its influence was communicated
to the lucubrations of the poet, the historian, and the divine.” The
book is a mixture of what has been termed the heroic and the pastoral romance,
interspersed with interludes and episodes, and details the various and marvellous
adventures of two friends, Musidorus and Pyrocles. It was not
intended to be published to the world, but was written merely to pleasure
the Countess of Pembroke&mdash;“a principal ornament to the family of the
Sidneys.” The famous epitaph, usually ascribed to the pen of Ben Jonson,
though in reality, it appears, written by William Browne, the author of
“Britannia’s Pastorals,” and preserved in a MS. volume of his poems in the
Lansdowne Collection in the British Museum, although so well known, will
bear repeating here:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Underneath this sable hearse<br />
Lies the subject of all verse,<br />
<i>Sidney’s</i> sister! <i>Pembroke’s</i> mother<br />
Death, ere thou hast slain another<br />
Fair, and learn’d, and good as she,<br />
Time shall throw a dart at thee!<br />
Marble piles let no man raise<br />
To her name for after-days;<br />
Some kind woman, born as she,<br />
Reading this, like Niobe,<br />
Shall turn marble, and become<br />
Both her mourner and her tomb.”</p>

<p class="p1">Again, however, Sidney returned to court, and his queen seized every
opportunity to do him honour. He received her smiles with the same high
and manly gallantry, the same plain and simple boldness, with which he had
taken her frowns. In the end, Elizabeth, who, to preserve this “jewel of
her crown,” had forcibly laid hands on him when he projected a voyage to
America with Sir Francis Drake, and placed her veto on his quitting England
when he was offered the crown of Poland, could not restrain his bravery in
battle when circumstances called him there. At Zutphen, on the 22nd of
September, 1586, he received a mortal wound; and here occurred the touching
incident to which, perhaps, more than to any other circumstance, Sir Philip is
indebted for his heroic fame. It is thus related by his friend and biographer,
Fulke Greville, Lord Broke:&mdash;“In his sad progress, passing along by the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of the army, where his uncle, the general, was, and being thirsty from excess
of bleeding, he called for drink, which was presently brought him; but, as he
was putting the bottle to his mouth, he saw a poor soldier carried along, who
had been wounded at the same time, ghastly, casting up his eyes at the bottle;
which Sir Philip perceiving, took it from his head before he drank, and delivered
to the poor man with these words: ‘Thy necessity is yet greater than mine.’
He lived in great pain for many days after he was wounded, and died on the
17th of October, 1586.” The close of his life affords a beautiful lesson.
“Calmly and steadily he awaited the approach of death. His prayers were
long and fervent; his bearing was indeed that of a Christian hero.” He had
a noble funeral; kings clad themselves in garments of grief: a whole people
grieved for the loss of the most accomplished scholar, the most graceful
courtier, the best soldier, and the worthiest man of the country and the age.
He was buried in state, in the old Cathedral of St. Paul, on the 16th of
February. Both Universities composed verses to his memory, and so general
was the mourning for him, that, “for many months after his death, it was
accounted indecent for any gentleman of quality to appear at court or in the
city in any light or gaudy apparel.”</p>

<p>We may place implicit faith in the testimony of the contemporaries of Sir
Philip Sidney; and by all of them he is described as very near perfection.
Their praises must have been as sincere as they were hearty; for his fortune
was too poor to furnish him with the means to purchase them with other than
gifts of kindly zeal, affectionate sympathy, cordial advice, and generous recommendations
to more prosperous men. From Spenser himself we learn that
Sidney</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“First did lift my muse out of the floor.”</p>

<p class="p1">In his dedication of the “Ruins of Time” to Sidney’s sister, he speaks of her
brother as “the hope of all learned men, and the patron of my young muse.”
“He was,” writes Camden, “the great glory of his family, the great hope of
mankind, the most lively pattern of virtue, and the darling of the learned
world.”</p>

<p>Sir Philip, dying without issue, was succeeded by his brother, Sir Robert
Sidney, who was created Lord Sidney of Penshurst, and afterwards Viscount
Lisle and Earl of Leicester, and a Knight of the Garter, by James I. He died
at Penshurst in July, 1626, and was succeeded in his title and estates by his
son, Robert, as second Earl of Leicester. This nobleman was “several times
ambassador to foreign courts, and in 1641 was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of
Ireland, but, through some unfounded aspersions cast against his fidelity and
honour, he was never permitted to seat himself in his new station, and was
ultimately dispossessed of it.” He retired in disgust to Penshurst, where he
spent his time in literary retirement, for he was well read in the classics, and
spoke Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish, and purchased most of the curious
books in those languages, “and several learned men made him presents of
their works.” He remained in retirement at Penshurst during the domination
of the Parliament and the rule of the Protector, and died there in November,
1677, in the eighty-second year of his age. His lordship, who married the
Lady Dorothea Percy, had fourteen children, six sons and eight daughters.
His eldest son, Philip, succeeded to the title and estates, and lived in troubled
times the life of an easy gentleman. Not so the second son, Algernon, the
famous scion of the Sidneys, whose name is scarcely less renowned in history
than that of his great-uncle, Sir Philip. Of the daughters, Lady Dorothea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
became Countess of Sunderland, and she was the famous “Sacharissa” of the
poet Waller. Waller wooed her in vain; she estimated the frivolous poet at
his true value. He called her “Sacharissa&mdash;a name, as he used to say pleasantly,
derived from <i>saccharum</i>, sugar.” Sacharissa and her lover met long
after the spring of life, and on her asking him “when he would write such
fine verses on her again?” the poet ungallantly replied, “Oh, madam, when
you are as young again!” Algernon Sidney was born at Penshurst, in 1621.
He had scarcely reached the age of manhood when he was called upon to play
his part in the mighty drama then acting before the world. He joined the
Parliament, and became a busy soldier&mdash;serving with repute in Ireland,
where he was “some time Lieutenant-General of the Horse and Governor of
Dublin,” until Cromwell assumed the position of a sovereign, when Sidney
retired in disgust to the family seat in Kent, and began to write his celebrated
“Discourses on Government.” At the Restoration he was abroad, and “being
so noted a republican,” thought it unsafe to return to England; for seventeen
years after this event he was a wanderer throughout Europe, suffering severe
privations, “exposed (according to his own words) to all those troubles,
inconveniences, and mischiefs into which they are liable who have nothing
to subsist upon, in a place farre from home, wheare no assistance can possibly
be expected, and wheare I am known to be of a quality which makes all lowe
and meane wayes of living shamefull and detestible.” The school of adversity
failed to subdue the proud spirit of the republican; and on his return to his
native country, 1677, at the entreaty of his father, “who desired to see him
before he died,” the “later Sidney” became a marked man, whom the depraved
Charles and his minions were resolved to sacrifice. He was accused of high
treason, implicated in the notorious Rye House Plot, carried through a form
of trial on the 21st of November, and beheaded on Tower Hill on the 8th of
December, 1683. His execution was a judicial murder.</p>

<p>Philip, third earl, lived to a great age, eighty-two, and dying in 1696, was
succeeded by his grandson, John, who, dying unmarried, was succeeded successively
by two of his brothers; the last earl, Jocelyn, died in 1748, without
any legitimate issue. He, however, left a natural daughter, afterwards
married to Mr. Streatfield, to whom he devised the whole of his estates. His
next elder brother, Colonel Thomas Sidney, who died before him, had, however,
left two daughters, to whom the estate properly devolved as co-heiresses;
and after a long course of litigation their right was established, and the
guardians of the young lady found it necessary to consent to a compromise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
(sanctioned by Act of Parliament) with the husbands of the two co-heiresses.
In the division of the property, Penshurst passed to the younger of the co-heiresses,
Elizabeth, wife of William Perry, Esq. (who assumed the name of
Sidney), of Turville Park, Buckinghamshire, who repaired the mansion, and
added to its collection of pictures. He died in 1757, and his widow, Mrs.
Perry-Sidney, was left in sole possession. This lady, after the death of her
elder sister, Lady Sherrard, purchased most of the family estates which had
fallen to that lady’s share. A claim to the estates and title of Earl of Leicester
was made by a son of the countess of the last earl (Jocelyn), born after her
separation from her husband, but was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Mrs. Perry-Sidney had an only son, Algernon Perry-Sidney, who died
during her lifetime, but left two daughters, his and her co-heiresses, to the
elder of whom, Elizabeth, who was married to Bysshe Shelley, Esq., Penshurst
passed. Their son, Sir John Shelley Sidney, Bart., inherited Penshurst
and the manors and estates in Kent; he was created a baronet in 1818. He
was succeeded as second baronet by his son, Sir Philip Charles Sidney,
D.C.L., G.C.H., &amp;c., who was an equerry to the king. He was born in
1800, and in 1825 married the Lady Sophia Fitzclarence, one of the daughters
of his Majesty King William IV. and Mrs. Jordan, and sister to the Earl of
Munster. In 1835 he was raised to the peerage by William IV., by the title
of Baron de L’Isle and Dudley. By his wife, the Lady Sophia Fitzclarence
(who died in 1837), his lordship had issue one son, the present peer, and
three daughters, the Honourable Adelaide Augusta Wilhelmina, married to
her cousin, the Honourable Frederick Charles George Fitzclarence (who has
assumed the name of Hunlocke), son of the first Earl of Munster; the Honourable
Ernestine Wellington, married to Philip Percival, Esq.; and the Honourable
Sophia Philippa.</p>

<p>The present noble owner of Penshurst, Philip Sidney, second Baron
de L’Isle and Dudley, and a baronet, was born in 1828. He was educated
at Eton, and was an officer in the Royal Horse Guards. He is a Deputy-Lieutenant
of Kent and of Yorkshire, and Hereditary Visitor of Sidney-Sussex
College, Cambridge. His lordship, who succeeded his father in 1851, married,
in 1850, Mary, only daughter of Sir William Foulis, Bart., of Ingleby Manor,
and has issue living, by her, four sons, the Honourable Philip, the heir-presumptive
to the title, born 1853; the Honourable Algernon, born 1854:
the Honourable Henry, born 1858; and the Honourable William, born 1859;
and one daughter, the Honourable Mary Sophia, born 1851.</p>

about thirty miles from London. The neighbourhood is remarkably primitive.
As an example of the prevailing character of the houses, we have copied a group

forefathers of the hamlet, with brave knights of imperishable renown, and
near which is an elm of prodigious size and age, that has seen generations
after generations flourish and decay. The sluggish Medway creeps lazily
round the park, which consists of about 400 acres, finely wooded, and happily
diversified with hill and dale. A double row of beech-trees of some extent
preserves the name of “Sacharissa’s Walk,” and a venerable oak, called
“Sidney’s Oak,” the trunk of which is hollowed by time, is pointed out as
the veritable tree that was planted on the day of Sir Philip’s birth; of which
Rare Ben Jonson thus writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“That taller tree of which a nut we set<br />
At his great birth when all the muses met;”&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">to which Waller makes reference as “the sacred mark of noble Sidney’s birth;”
concerning which Southey also has some lines; and from which a host of lesser
poets have drawn inspiration.</p>

<p>Until within the last thirty or forty years Penshurst House was in a sadly
dilapidated state. Its utter ruin, indeed, appeared a settled thing, until
Lord de L’Isle set himself to the task of its restoration, and under his admirable
direction it rapidly assumed its ancient character&mdash;a combination of
several styles of architecture, in which the Tudor predominated. One of our
views is of the mansion, from the principal approach through the park. In
another view the west front is shown, the north front being seen in short perspective;
on the left is “Sir Henry’s Tower,” containing his arms, and an
inscription stating that he was “Lord Deputie General of the Realm of Ireland
in 1579.” This tower terminates the north wing, in which is the principal
entrance, by an ancient gateway, leading through one of the smaller courts to
the great hall. Over this gateway is an antique slab, setting forth that “The
most religious and renowned Prince, Edward the Sixt, Kinge of England,
France, and Ireland, gave this house of Pencestre with the manors, landes
and appurtenaynces thereunto belonginge to, unto his trustye and well-beloved
servant, Syr William Sidney, Knight Banneret.”</p>

<p>We cannot do better than ask our readers to accompany Mr. Parker in his
tour through the house. Ascending the staircase on one side of the hall, the
company passed through the solar or lord’s chamber, at one end of which
Mr. Parker thought the chapel had been originally screened off, and that it was
changed into a ball-room in the reign of Queen Anne. The Buckingham
Building, which was next visited, was found to have been admirably restored,
although it had fallen into a sad state of ruin. Fragments of one of the old
windows, however, were discovered, and these enabled the architect to restore
it completely. Mr. Parker considered it to be one of the most beautiful
instances of restoration he had seen. It gave a most vivid idea of its original
state. The company then descended into the lower chamber or parlour of the
house of the time of Edward III., which was perfectly preserved, and an excellent
example of a mediæval vaulted substructure. Passing to the Elizabethan
house, the company entered a suite of rooms elegantly furnished, and containing
many exceedingly interesting objects. The chairs were of the time of
Charles II., of English manufacture, and the best specimens of that date that
could be found. There were also a couch of the same period, and an Augsburg
clock of the seventeenth century, some very old and valuable paintings, and
choice cabinets of carved ebony. Among other curiosities was an illustration of
the funeral procession of Sir Philip Sidney. Mr. Parker then drew attention to
the exterior architectural style of the Buckingham Building, added in the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of Richard II., and admirably restored by the architect. The recent restoration
of the Elizabethan Building had also been ably done. The windows
were especially noticeable, by the skilful manner in which the work had been
executed after the style of fragments of the old work. The Elizabethan front
was also an object of much interest. The exterior architecture in the servants’
court was a noble composition, full of interest.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>The Hall and Minstrels’ Gallery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus the “restorations” have been made in good taste and with sound
judgment; and the seat of the Sidneys has regained its rank as one of the
finest and most extensive edifices in the county of Kent.</p>

<p>In the interior the “Hall” is remarkably fine and interesting, with good
architectural features. The pointed timber roof, upon which the slates are
laid, is supported by a series of grotesque life-size corbels; and the screen
of the gallery is richly carved and panelled. The gallery&mdash;“The Minstrels’
Gallery”&mdash;fills the side opposite the dais, and the Gothic windows are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
narrow and lofty. Every object, indeed, calls to mind and illustrates the
age of feudalism. The oak tables, on which retainers feasted, still occupy
the hall, and in its centre are the huge dogs in an octagonal enclosure,
beneath the louvre, or lanthorn, in the roof, which formerly permitted egress
to the smoke.</p>

<p>“On each side of the hall,” writes Mr. Parker, “were two tables and
benches, which, if not actually contemporaneous with it, were certainly
among the earliest pieces of furniture remaining in England. There was no
doubt a similar&mdash;or probably a more ornamental&mdash;one on the daïs at the
upper end of the hall where the Elizabethan table now stood, which was
used by the lord and his more honoured guests, the side tables in the lower
part of the hall being for the domestics and retainers, and guests of that
class. One end of the daïs had been altered, so that the original arrangement
could not be seen; but there would necessarily be at one end the sideboard,
or buffet, filled with plate, arranged on shelves to be well displayed, whilst
it also formed a sort of cupboard, with doors which could be closed and
locked. This piece of furniture was usually placed in the recess formed by a
bay window in halls of the fifteenth century, but it was doubtful whether
the bay window was in use as early as the fourteenth. At the opposite end
of the daïs was the door to the staircase of the solar or upper chamber, used
as the withdrawing-room for the ladies after dinner; and by its side there
was another door leading to the cellar. This was originally the lower
chamber under the solar, but afterwards there was often a short passage to
the cellar, which was sometimes underground, and the original cellar, or
lower chamber, became the parlour. But there were always two chambers,
one over the other, behind the daïs, the two together often not reaching so
high as the roof of the hall. The upper room was the lord’s chamber, from
which there was usually a look-out into the hall, as a check to the more
riotous proceedings after the lord and his family or his guests had retired;
or for the lords to see that the guests were assembled before descending with
his family into the hall. In the centre of the hall was the original hearth
or reredos, almost the only one, he believed, remaining. By the side of it
were the andirons, or fire-dogs, for arranging logs of wood upon the hearth,
and over it was an opening in the roof, with a small ornamented turret to
cover it, called a smoke-louvre, which unfortunately had been removed, after
having been previously Italianised and spoilt. The custom of having a large
fire of logs of wood in the hall continued long after fire-places and chimneys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
were used in the other chambers; and it was a mistake to suppose that they
were unknown in this country until the fifteenth century. There were many
fire-places and chimneys of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in the
chambers, but it was not customary to use them in the hall before the
fifteenth. In spite of all the modern contrivances for warming rooms, it
might be doubted whether for warming a large and lofty hall it was possible
to obtain more heat from the same quantity of fuel than was obtained from
the open fire, and where the space was so large and the roof so high that
no practical inconvenience could be felt from the smoke, which naturally
ascended and escaped by the louvre.”</p>

<p>Leaving the hall, the Ball-room is entered; it is long and narrow, the
walls being covered with family portraits&mdash;some original, some copies.
Queen Elizabeth’s room succeeds: it contains much of the furniture, tapestry-covered,
that was placed there when the virgin queen visited the mansion.
In one corner is an ancient mandoline; some portraits of the chiefs of the
heroic race are here; and here is a singular picture, representing Queen
Elizabeth dancing with the Earl of Leicester. The family portraits are
gathered in the “Picture Gallery;” it contains no others; none but a
member of it has been admitted with one exception&mdash;that of Edward VI.,
who gave the estate to the Sidneys. Among them are several of Sir Philip
and Algernon Sidney, one of Sir Philip’s sister, the Countess of Pembroke,
to whom he addressed the “Arcadia,” and who is immortalised in the epitaph
we have just given, and one by Lely of the “Sacharissa” of the muse of
Waller. A small chamber in the mansion contains, however, a few treasures
of rarer value than all its copies of “fair women and brave men.” Among
some curious family relics and records is a lock of Sir Philip Sidney’s hair; it
is of a pale auburn. A lock of the hair of the ill-fated Algernon is also with
it, and in tint nearly resembles that of his illustrious great-uncle.</p>

<p>There are many other relics of interest and value scattered throughout the
mansion, but towards the close of the last century a grand collection of ancient
armour, worn by generations of the Sidneys, richly emblazoned and inlaid, was
sold as old iron that cumbered one of the rooms of the house; while MSS. of
inestimable worth, including correspondence with the leading worthies of many
centuries, mysteriously disappeared, and were probably consumed as waste
paper, useful only for lighting fires.</p>

<p>The church at Penshurst is dedicated to St. John the Baptist. It immediately
adjoins the park, and is connected, by a private walk, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
gardens of the mansion. It is an ancient and very venerable structure,
containing many monuments to the Sidneys, and to members of the families
of Dragnowt, Cambridge, Egerton, Head, Darkenol, Pawle, and Yden. The
most interesting and beautifully wrought of the tombs is to the memory
of Sir William Sidney, Knight Banneret, Chamberlain and Steward to
Edward VI., and Lord of the Manor of Penshurst, who died in 1553. It
stands in a small chapel at the west end of the chancel, and at the foot of
the tomb is a very antique figure, carved in marble, supposed to be a
memorial to Sir Stephen de Pencestre. Below is the vault which contains
the dust of generations of the Sidneys. Sir William Sidney’s monument
is a fine example of art, elaborately and delicately sculptured; it contains
a long inscription, engraved on a brass tablet, the lettering in which is as
clear and as sharp as if it were the work of yesterday. The roof of this
chapel is peculiarly light and elegant. In both exterior and interior it is
highly picturesque. The oak gallery is one of the earliest erections of the
kind that followed the Reformation. Mr. Parker, in his address to the
Archæological Society, thus spoke of the church:&mdash;“It exhibited specimens
of the architecture of various periods, and is interesting as the burial-place
of the ancient families that inhabited the mansion. The north side was of
the time of Henry III., and was probably built by Sir Stephen Penchester;
the south side in the time of Edward III. The chancel chapel at the end
of the south aisle was the burial-place of the Pulteney family. There were
also two chantry chapels on the north side, one of the time of Edward I.,
and the other of the time of Henry VI. Amongst the other interesting
monuments and tablets there is one commemorative of the late illustrious
Lord Hardinge.”</p>

<p>In all respects, therefore, a visit to <span class="smcap">Penshurst</span>&mdash;now by railroad within
an hour’s distance of the metropolis&mdash;may be described as a rare intellectual
treat, opening a full and brilliant page of history, abundant in sources of
profitable enjoyment to the antiquary, affording a large recompense to the
lover or the professor of Art, and exhibiting nature under a vast variety
of aspects.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p class="dc14">WARWICK CASTLE holds foremost rank among the
Stately Homes of England, both from its historical
associations, and the important positions which, in
every age, its lords have occupied in the annals of
our country. Situated in one of the most romantic
and beautiful districts of a fertile and productive
shire, overlooking the “sweet-flowing Avon,” and
retaining all its characteristics of former strength and
grandeur, Warwick Castle is renowned among the
most interesting remains of which the kingdom can
boast. Of its original foundation, like that of other
of our older strongholds, nothing is really known,
although much is surmised. It is said to have been
a Celtic settlement, converted into a fortress by the
Roman invaders. However this may be&mdash;and there
were several ancient British and Roman roads and
stations in the county&mdash;it is not our purpose to
inquire. It will suffice to say that at the time of the
Roman conquest of Warwickshire, which is said to
have occurred about the year 50, the county was
occupied by two tribes of ancient Britons, the Cornavii and Dobuni, the
boundary between these territories being, it would seem, the river Avon.
Near the Avon, relics of frontier fortresses on either side have&mdash;as at Brownsover,
Brailes, Burton Dassett, Brinklow, &amp;c.,&mdash;been found; the principal
British and Roman roads being the Icknield Street, the Fosse Way, and
Watling Street. Warwick is believed, and not without reason, to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
one of these frontier fortresses; its situation would seem to lend strength to
the supposition. In Anglo-Saxon times, Warwick formed a part of the kingdom
of Mercia, the capital of which was at Repton, in the neighbouring county
of Derby. At that period it “fell under the dominion of Warremund, who
rebuilt it, and called it Warrewyke, after his own name.” Having been taken
and destroyed by the Danes, it “so rested,” says Dugdale, “until the
renowned Lady Ethelfled, daughter to King Alfred&mdash;who had the whole earldom
of Mercia given her by her father to the noble Etheldred in marriage&mdash;repaired
its ruins, and in the year of Christ <span class="smcap lowercase">DCCCCXV</span> made a strong fortification
here, called the dungeon, for resistance of the enemy, upon a hill of earth,
artificially raised near the river side;” and this formed the nucleus of the
present building. In 1016 it is stated to have again suffered from an attack
by the Danes, who nearly demolished the fortifications of the castle and did
great damage to the town. At the time of making the Domesday survey,
Warwick was a royal burgh, and “contained 261 houses, and with its castle
was regarded as a place of much consequence; for orders were issued by the
Conqueror to Turchel to repair and fortify the town and castle of Warwick.
This was carried into effect, by surrounding the town with a strong
wall and ditch, and by enlarging the castle and strengthening its fortifications.”</p>

<p>In 1172 (19th Henry II.), Warwick Castle was provisioned and garrisoned
at an expense of £10 (which would be equivalent to about £200 of our
present money), on behalf of the king; and during those troublous times it
remained about three years in his hands. In 1173 a sum equal to about £500
of our money was paid to the soldiers in the castle; and in the following year,
the building requiring considerable repair, about £50 was laid out upon it, and
a considerable sum was paid to the soldiers who defended it for the king. In
1191 it was again repaired, and also in the reign of King John. In the 48th
of Henry III. (1263), William Mauduit, Earl of Warwick, was surprised by
the adherents of Simon de Montfort, then holding Kenilworth, and the walls
of the castle were completely destroyed; indeed, so complete was the
devastation, that in 1315 “it was returned in an inquisition as worth nothing
excepting the herbage in the ditches, valued at 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>” In 1337 (12th
Edward III.) a new building was commenced, and in that year a royal licence
was granted for the founding of a chantry chapel in the castle. The building
was commenced by Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, whose monument
is preserved in the Beauchamp Chapel. In 1394 (17th Richard II.) Guy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Tower is said to have been completed by Thomas Beauchamp, second son of
the last named Thomas, at a cost of £395 5<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, and by him to have been
named “Guy’s Tower.” In the reign of James I. a sum of about £20,000
was expended by the then owner of the castle, Fulke Greville, Lord Broke,
“in making it habitable and restoring it to its former importance.” From
this time downwards, the castle has undergone many alterations, and so-called
“beautifyings,” at the hands of its different owners; but, despite all, it
retained its ancient grandeur and its most interesting features, and was, as
Sir Walter Scott has said, “the fairest monument of ancient and chivalrous
splendour which remains uninjured by time.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Castle, from the Temple Field.</i></p>
</div>

<p>And now as to its long line of illustrious and valiant owners.</p>

<p>Passing over the whimsical list of earls, &amp;c., in Rous’s Roll, beginning
with “King Guthelyne, about the sixth of Kinge Alexander the greate conqueror,”
and “Kinge Gwydered, who began to reigne the 4th yere from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
birth of our Lord,” reminding one very forcibly of the “Promptuaire des
Medalles,” which commences the series with those of “Adam” and of “Heva
vx Adam,”&mdash;the first we need even hint at, so obscure is the matter, is Rohan
de Arden, who is stated to have married a daughter and heiress of “Æneas,
Earl of Warwick, in the time of the Saxons,” and to have succeeded to that
title and estates. Rohan de Arden is said to have lived in the reigns of Alfred
and Edward the Elder, and to have been succeeded by the “renowned Guy,”
Earl of Warwick (the legend connected with him will be noticed on subsequent
pages), who had married his only daughter and heiress, Felicia. This Sir Guy
“is said to have been son of Syward, Lord of Wallingford, which possession
Guy also enjoyed.” “He was often in conflicts with the Danes in defence of
his country; did many brave exploits; and, lastly, as the story goes, after his
return from the Holy Land, retired from the world, and turn’d hermit, and
lived in an adjacent cave, now called ‘Guy’s Cliff,’ wherein he died, and was
buried in a chapel there, anno 929, aged about seventy years, leaving issue,
by Felicia his wife, Reynborne,” who succeeded him, and “married Leonora,
or Leoneta, daughter to King Athelstan.” From him the descent is said to
have been continued in regular succession through father and son (Wegeat or
Weyth, Wygod, Alcuin or Aylwin, &amp;c.) to Turchel, who was earl at the time
of the Norman Conquest, and who was allowed by that monarch to retain
possession of the estates, but was ultimately deprived of both them and of the
earldom.</p>

<p>The castle having been strengthened and enlarged, its custody was given
to Henry de Newburgh, a Norman, who had accompanied the Conqueror,
and to him was afterwards granted all the possessions of Turchel de
Warwick, and he was made Earl of Warwick. By some he is said to have
married the daughter of Turchel, but he is also stated to have married three
other ladies. He was succeeded by his son, Roger Newburgh, as second Earl
of Warwick, who married Gundred, daughter of the second Earl Warren, by
whom he had a son, William, who succeeded him as third earl, and dying
without issue, was succeeded by his brother Walleran as fourth earl, who
married twice&mdash;first, Margaret de Bohun, and second, Alice de Harcourt. By
his first wife he had two sons, Henry, who succeeded him, and Walleran.
Henry de Newburgh, fifth Earl of Warwick, was a minor at his father’s death
in 1205, and was placed under Thomas Bassett, of Headington, near Oxford.
In the thirteenth year of King John, he was certified as holding 107 knights’
fees of the king <i>in capite</i>. Having led an active military life, and married two
wives&mdash;Margaret D’Oyley and Philippa Bassett&mdash;he died 1229, and was succeeded
as sixth earl by his son, Thomas de Newburgh.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Keep, from the Inner Court.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This nobleman married a daughter of the Earl of Salisbury, but died without issue. His
sister and heiress, Margery, who was married to John de Mareschal, brother
to the Earl of Pembroke, succeeded to the estates, and her husband became
seventh earl. This honour he did not enjoy long, but died without issue
“within about half a year of his brother-in-law the late earl.” The widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
then, by special arrangement of Henry III., married John de Placetis, or
Plessitis, a Norman by birth, and a great favourite of the king. By the
Countess of Warwick he had no issue, and therefore at her death the estates
passed to her cousin, William Mauduit, Baron of Hanslape, who died without
issue. The title and estates then at his death passed to his sister, Isabel
Mauduit, wife of William de Beauchamp, heir of Walter de Beauchamp, Baron
of Elmley, who thus through her became heir to the title, which however,&mdash;she
having entered a nunnery,&mdash;was not claimed, but passed, in the person of
their son William, into the powerful family of Beauchamp. By Isabel Mauduit
William de Beauchamp the elder had four sons&mdash;William, who succeeded him;
John, whose grandson was created Baron Beauchamp; Walter, ancestor of
Fulke Greville, Lord Broke; and Thomas, who died unmarried. William de
Beauchamp, who bore the title of Earl of Warwick during his father’s lifetime,
married Maud, one of the co-heiresses of Richard Fitzjohn, by whom he
had issue with others, Guy de Beauchamp, who succeeded him as Earl of
Warwick. This Guy, so called, no doubt, after the “renowned Guy,”
attended the king into Scotland, and for his valour at the battle of Falkirk,
had granted to him all the lands of Geoffrey de Mowbray in that kingdom,
with the exception of Okeford, and all the lands of John de Strivelin, with the
castle of Amesfield, and the lands of Drungery. He was one of the noblemen
who seized Piers Gaveston,&mdash;against whom he held a mortal hatred for having
called him “the black hound of Arden,”&mdash;whom he conveyed to Warwick
Castle, from whence he was removed to Blacklow Hill, near Warwick, and
beheaded. This Guy married Alice, sister and heiress to Robert de Toni,
Baron of Flamstead, and widow of Thomas de Leybourne, and by her had
issue two sons and five daughters. He died (it was suspected by poison) in
1315, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas de Beauchamp, who
married Catherine Mortimer, daughter of the Earl of March, by whom he had
issue seven sons and ten daughters. The sons were&mdash;Sir Guy, “a stout
soldier,” who died in his father’s lifetime, leaving three daughters, all nuns,
at Shouldham; Thomas, his successor; Reynbourne, so called in memory of
the son of the “renowned Guy;” William, who became Lord Abergavenny;
Roger, John, and Jerome.</p>

</div>

<p>Thomas Beauchamp, the eldest son, who succeeded to the honours, was
knighted in the lifetime of his father. He, like his predecessor, made many
additions to the castle, the principal of which was the building of Guy’s Tower.
Having passed a troublous life, being at one time confined and condemned in
the Tower of London, he died in 1401, leaving by his wife Margaret, daughter
of Lord Ferrars of Groby, two daughters, nuns, and one son, Richard
Beauchamp, who succeeded him. This Richard, Earl of Warwick, is said to
“have surpassed even the great valour and reputation of his ancestors;” and,
indeed, his career seems altogether to have been one of the most brilliant and
successful on record; and besides having a special herald of his own,
“Warwick Herald,” he was styled the “Father of Courtesye.” “He
founded the Chantry of Guy’s Cliff, where before this foundation were Guy’s
Chappel and Cottage.” In this he placed the statue of Guy (still seen, though
much defaced), made several pious donations, and died at Roan in the 17th
of Henry VI. There is extant a very remarkable and curious MS. Life of
this renowned warrior; it is preserved in the British Museum (Julius, E. IV.).
In it the illuminations are very spirited, and are highly valuable as examples
of armour, &amp;c., of the time, no less than as genuine representations of various
valiant deeds in which he was engaged.</p>

<p>Three of these we give. Our first
shows the figures of the Earl of Warwick and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
from a picture of the fight with Philip, Duke of Burgundy, before Calais. The
next represents “how a mighty duke challenged Erle Richard (Beauchamp)
for his lady sake, and in justyng slewe the Duke, and then the Empresse toke
the Erle’s staff and bear from a knight’s shouldre, and for great love and
favour she sett it on her shouldre. Then Erle Richard made one of perle and
precious stones, and offered her that, and she gladly and lovynglee reseaved
it.” The engraving shows the Earl vanquishing the Duke&mdash;his lance has run
through his body&mdash;and the heralds proclaiming his victory. Behind are the
Emperor Sigismund and his Empress, the latter of whom is taking, as
recounted, the Earl’s badge of the bear and ragged staff from the shoulders
of the knight to place upon her own. On the Earl’s helmet will be seen his
crest of the bear and ragged staff.</p>

<p>In the third engraving we see the Earl of Warwick setting out in his own
ship, on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He is dressed in pilgrim guise, and,
staff in hand, is just stepping into the boat to be conveyed to the ship, his
attendants and luggage following him. The ship is sumptuously fitted with
castle and state apartments, and has the sail emblazoned with the Beauchamp
arms, and the pennon, besides the St. George’s cross of England, bears the
bear and ragged staff many times repeated. This badge will be best understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
by the accompanying engraving. The Earl had two wives; first,
Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Thomas, Lord Berkley; and second, Isabel,
daughter of Thomas le Despencer, Earl of
Gloucester. He was succeeded by his son
Henry, who was then barely fourteen
years old.</p>

<p>This Henry de Beauchamp&mdash;who had
during his father’s lifetime been called
De Spencer, through his mother’s possessions&mdash;when
only nineteen years of age
tendered his services to Henry VI. for the
defence of Acquitane, for which the king
created him Premier Earl of England,
with leave to distinguish himself and his
heirs male by wearing in his presence a
gold coronet.</p>

<p>Three days later, he was created <span class="smcap">Duke</span> of Warwick, with precedence next
to the Duke of Norfolk. After this, he had granted to him, in reversion, the
Islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Sark, Erme, and Alderney, which he was to hold
for the yearly tribute of a rose. He was also by his sovereign crowned King
of the Isle of Wight, his Majesty himself placing the crown upon his head.
This young nobleman, however, with all his honours thick upon him, lived but
a short life of greatness, and died at Warwick at the early age of twenty-two,
in 1445. He married Cicely, daughter of Richard Nevil, Earl of Salisbury,
by whom he had an only child, Anne, Countess of Warwick, who died when
only six years of age, leaving her aunt Anne, wife of Richard Nevil, Earl of
Salisbury, heir to the titles and estates, and thus they passed to the family of
Nevil.</p>

<p>This Richard Nevil, then Earl of Warwick, is the one so well known in
English history as “the stout Earl of Warwick, the king-maker,”&mdash;“peremptory
Warwick,” the “wind-changing Warwick,” of Shakspere&mdash;who,
“finding himself strong enough to hold the balance between the families
of York and Lancaster, rendered England during the reign of his power a
scene of bloodshed and confusion; and made or unmade kings of this or that
house as best suited his passions, pleasures, or interests. His life was passed
in wars and broils, destructive to his country and his family.” He was killed
at the battle of Barnet in 1471. He left issue two daughters, Isabel, married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
to George, Duke of Clarence and brother to Edward IV.; and Anne, married
first to Edward, Prince of Wales, and secondly, to his murderer, Richard,
Duke of Gloucester, subsequently King Richard III. To the eldest of these
daughters, Isabel, came the Warwick estates; and her husband, George
Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, was, by his brother Edward IV., created Earl
of Warwick and Salisbury. That ill-fated and indiscreet nobleman, however,
did not live to carry out improvements he had commenced at Warwick. His
wife was poisoned; and he himself, later on, was attainted of high treason,
and was drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine
in the Tower, by order of his brother, the
Duke of Gloucester.</p>

</div>

<p>During all this time, Anne, Countess of
Warwick, widow of Richard Nevil, had undergone
great privations&mdash;her possessions being
taken from her for her daughters’ husbands&mdash;and
had been living in obscurity; by Act
3rd Henry VII. she was recalled from such
obscurity to be restored to the possessions
of her family; “but that was a refinement
of cruelty, for shortly after obtaining possession
she was forced” to surrender to the
king all these immense possessions. After
her death, Edward Plantagenet, eldest son
of George, Duke of Clarence, assumed the
title of Earl of Warwick, but was beheaded
on Tower Hill. On his death the title was
held in abeyance, and was, after a time,
granted to John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, who was descended in the female
line from the old Earls of Warwick. This John Dudley, Earl of Warwick,
and Viscount Lisle, was made Lord High Chamberlain, a Knight of the
Garter, Lord Warden of the North, and Earl Marshal: and was created
Duke of Northumberland, but was attainted for the part he took relating to
Lady Jane Grey, and beheaded on Tower Hill in 1553. He married Jane,
daughter of Sir Edward Guildford, by whom he had a large family, of whom
the eldest, Henry, was killed at the siege of Boulogne; the second, John, was
called Earl of Warwick during his father’s lifetime; Ambrose, who was created
Earl of Warwick; Guildford, who was beheaded with his father; Robert, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
was created Earl of Leicester, and others. In 1557 Ambrose Dudley, the
third son, having obtained a reversion of the attainder, had the estates
restored to him, and was re-created Earl of Warwick. He married three
wives, but had no issue by either, and dying in 1589, the title became
extinct.</p>

<p>In 1618 the title of Earl of Warwick was conferred by James I. on Robert,
Lord Rich, but, not being descended from the former earls, the estates did not
fall into his hands. Dying in a few months after his creation, he was
succeeded by his son, Robert Rich, Lord High Admiral for the Long Parliament,
whose son (afterwards Earl of Warwick) married Frances, the
youngest daughter of Oliver Cromwell. After passing through five other
members of this family, the title again became extinct, on the death of the
last earl of that name, Edward Rich, in 1759.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>In November of that year (1759) the title was conferred upon Francis
Greville, Lord Brooke, of the long and illustrious line of the Grevilles, and
a descendant of Fulke Greville, the “servaunt to Quene Elizabeth, Concellor
to King James, and Frend to Sir Philip Sidney,” to whom we have alluded in
our account of Penshurst. Francis, Lord Brooke, succeeded his father in the
barony, when only eight years of age. In 1746 he was raised to the dignity
of Earl Brooke, of Warwick Castle; and in 1759 was created Earl of Warwick,
with patent to bear the ancient crest of the earls&mdash;the bear and ragged staff.
He married a daughter of Lord Archibald Hamilton, by whom, besides others,
he had a son, George Greville, who succeeded him as second earl of that line.
His lordship married, first, Georgiana, only daughter of Lord Selsey, who died
soon after the birth of her only child, a year after marriage; the child, a son,
living to the age of fourteen. He married, secondly, Henrietta, daughter of
R. Vernon, Esq., and his wife, the Countess of Ossory, and sister of the
Marquis of Stafford. By that lady he had three sons and six daughters.
Dying in 1816, he was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Richard Greville,
as Earl Brooke, Earl of Warwick, &amp;c., who, in 1816, married Lady Sarah
Elizabeth Saville, daughter of the Earl of Mexborough, and widow of Lord
Monson: she died in 1851. By this lady his lordship (who died in 1853) had
an only son, the present peer.</p>

<p>George Guy Greville, Earl Brooke, Earl of Warwick, and Baron Brooke of
Beauchamp’s Court, all in the peerage of the United Kingdom, was born in
March, 1818, and was educated at St. John’s College, Cambridge, where
he took his degrees. In 1853 he succeeded his father as fourth Earl of
Warwick, of that line, and in the previous year (1852) married the Lady Ann
Charteris, eldest daughter of the Earl of Wemyss, by whom he has issue living,
four sons and one daughter, viz.:&mdash;the Hon. Francis Richard Charles Guy
Greville (Lord Brooke), born in 1853, his heir-presumptive; the Hon. Alwyn
Henry Fulke Greville, born in 1854; the Hon. Louis George Greville, born
in 1856; the Hon. Sidney Robert Greville, born in 1866; and the Hon. Eva
Sarah Louisa Greville, born in 1860. His lordship, who sat in Parliament
for South Warwickshire from 1846 to the time of succeeding to the title in
1853, is Lieutenant-Colonel of the Warwickshire Yeomanry, a Trustee of
Rugby School, and is patron of five livings.</p>

<p>The arms of the present peer are&mdash;<i>sable</i>, on a cross within a bordure, all
engrailed, <i>or</i>, five pellets. Crests&mdash;first, out of a ducal coronet, <i>gules</i>, a demi-swan

<p>Having thus glanced at the history of the place, and spoken of the long line
of noble and illustrious owners, both of the estates and the title, let us turn to
the castle itself, as it stood and was furnished, at the time of our visit. Alas!
that we should have to write this in a past sense, and say “stood” in place
of “stands.” Alas! that within a few short weeks of our visit, and of our
writing these notes, a great part of the building was “gutted” by fire, and
many of its most important and interesting features destroyed. It is, however,
being rapidly and wisely restored, and doubtless will, ere long, rise
“phœnix-like” from the ashes, with renewed beauty. We give our notes as
we wrote them before this calamity occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<div>
  <img class="dc1" src="images/ill-206.jpg" width="200" height="305" id="a206" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="dc13 p2">THE Castle occupies the summit of a steep hill, which
must greatly have aided its artificial defences in the
“olden time.” The present approach to it is
by a narrow passage cut through the solid rock,
and extending from the main entrance to the
porter’s lodge fronting the road to Leamington.
Passing through this lodge, the visitor, after
proceeding some distance along the rocky passages,
enters the outer court-yard, “where the
stupendous line of fortifications breaks suddenly
upon the sight in all its bold magnificence.” Of
the two famous towers that of Guy is on the
right, while that of Cæsar is on the left;
they are connected by a strong embattled
wall, in the centre of which is the ponderous
arched gateway, flanked by towers, and succeeded by a second arched
gateway, with towers and battlements, “formerly defended by two portholes,
one of which still remains; before the whole is a disused moat,
with an arch thrown over it at the gateway, where was once a drawbridge.”
Passing the double gateway the court-yard is entered. Thus seen, the
castellated mansion of the most famous of the feudal barons has a tranquil
and peaceful aspect; fronting it is a green sward and the “frowning keep,”
which conceals all its gloomier features behind a screen of ivy and evergreen
shrubs. Uninjured by time, and unaltered in appearance by modern improvements,
except in being surrounded and made picturesque by trees and shrubs,
it still stands, as of old, on the top of its mound. The “Bear Tower,” with a
flight of steps descending to a subterranean passage, leading no one knows
whither, will be noticed, as also will “Guy’s Tower.”</p>

<p>From the inner court a flight of stone steps leads to the entrance to the
<span class="smcap">Great Hall</span>, which is of large size; its walls are decorated with arms and
armour of various periods and descriptions, and with antlers and other appropriate
objects. On one side of this hall are the state rooms, and on the other
the domestic apartments, forming a line of 333 feet in length. The Hall, and
indeed the whole of the interior, have been “subjected to the deleterious
influence of the upholsterer,” and are made gorgeous and beautiful in accordance
with modern taste, while they have lost their original features and
interesting characteristics. This work was, however, done some time ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and it must remain as it is: comfort and convenience have been studied
certainly; but all associations with the glory of ancient Warwick were rejected
by the modern architect in his restoration of the apartments of the venerable
castle. In the hall, however, there are many objects of rare interest; among
others the helmet studded with brass worn by the Protector Cromwell; the
suit of armour worn by Montrose; the doublet, “blood-spotted,” in which
Lord Broke was slain at Lichfield, in 1643; and the warder’s horn, the history
of which is told in this inscription:&mdash;</p>

et · superior : Licentia · Romæ · Floruit · 1598</span>.</p>

<p class="pn1">There is also a breech-loading revolving musket, some hundreds of years old
probably, which, but for the evidence of Time, might seem a direct plagiarism
on the revolver of Colonel Colt. The roof of the hall was designed by the
architect Poynter.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Red Drawing-Room</span> contains many fine paintings and several articles
of <i>vertu</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cedar Drawing-Room</span> is a remarkably elegant apartment, sumptuously
furnished, and having a magnificent and, said to be, unique chimney piece.
In this room are many remarkably fine paintings, including “Charles I.,” by
Vandyck; “Circe,” by Guido; the “Family of Charles I.,” &amp;c.; and some
highly interesting bronzes, Etruscan vases, &amp;c. The main feature of&mdash;</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Gilt Drawing-Room</span> is its superb geometric ceiling, which is richly
painted and gilt&mdash;the walls being decorated in a corresponding manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Among the paintings in this room may be noted the “Earl of Strafford,” by
Vandyck; “Algernon Percy,” by Dodson; “Charles I.,” “Henrietta Maria,”
and “Prince Rupert,” by Vandyck; “Ignatius Loyola,” by Rubens;
“Robert Bertie, Earl of Lindsay,” by Cornelius Jansen; “Robert Rich,
Earl of Warwick,” after Vandyck; a “Young Girl,” by Murillo; “Robert
Dudley, Earl of Leicester,” and many others.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">State Bed-Room</span>. The bed and furniture in this room are said
originally to have belonged to Queen Anne, and were presented to the
Warwick family by King George III. The walls are hung with Brussels
tapestry of the date of 1604. The bed and hangings are of crimson velvet.
Over the chimney-piece is a fine full-length portrait of Queen Anne by Sir Godfrey
Kneller; the room also contains other interesting paintings and ornaments.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Boudoir</span> is a lovely little room, forming the extreme west end of the
suite of rooms. The ceiling is enriched with the family crest and coronets,
and there are among the paintings a portrait of Henry VIII. by Holbein;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
of the Duchess of Cleveland, Barbara Villiers, by Lely; “A Dead Christ,” by
Carracci; “A Boar Hunt,” by Rubens; “Martin Luther,” by Holbein; “A
Sketch of the Evangelists,” by Rubens; and examples of Gerard Dow, Teniers,
Salvator Rosa, Hayter, Vandyck, Holbein (Anne Boleyn and Mary Boleyn
being especially interesting), Andrea del Sarto, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Compass-Room</span> contains many fine old paintings and much among its
articles of <i>vertu</i> that will interest the visitor. In&mdash;</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chapel Passage</span>, too, are highly interesting paintings; and in the
<span class="smcap">Chapel</span> are some stained glass and interesting local relics.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Dining-Room</span>, built by Francis, Earl of Warwick, is a noble
room, decorated with some fine antique busts and paintings. Among the
latter will be specially noticed portraits of “Sir Philip Sidney,” considered
the best in existence, and bearing in the corner the words, “The Original of
Sir Philip Sidney;” “Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester;” “Frederick,
Prince of Wales;” “The Princess of Wales and George III. when an Infant;”
and many family portraits. At the east end is the celebrated “Kenilworth
Buffet,” manufactured by Cookes of Warwick, from an oak-tree on the Kenilworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
estate, and representing in its panels various incidents connected with
Queen Elizabeth’s visit to that venerable pile, and presented to the present
earl, on his marriage, by the town and county of Warwick.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Castle, from the Outer Court.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The private apartments of the Castle consist of a remarkably elegant suite
of rooms, which are, of course, not shown to visitors. Of these, therefore,
only a few words need be said. The <span class="smcap">Armoury Passage</span> and the <span class="smcap">Armoury</span>
contain a rare assemblage of arms and armour of various ages and descriptions,
and many antiquities and “curiosities,” as well as mineralogical, geological,
and other collections of great interest. In the <span class="smcap">Billiard-Room</span>, the <span class="smcap">Oak
Sitting-Room</span>, the <span class="smcap">Earl’s Room</span>, and all the remaining apartments, are many
remarkably fine paintings.</p>

<p>Throughout the state apartments, as well as the private rooms, is distributed
a marvellous collection of treasures of art&mdash;“superb garde-robes, encoigneurs,
cabinets, and tables of buhl and marqueterie of the most costly finish; splendid
cups, flasks, and vases in ormolu, crystal, china, and lava; Etruscan vases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
marble and <i>pietra dura</i> tables; bronzes and busts displaying the utmost efforts
of art; costly bijouteries, and rare antiques;” more especially a large collection
of Limousin enamels are among the treasures which meet the eye at
every turn in the interior of Warwick Castle.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that the prospect from any of the windows is
singularly beautiful; so beautiful, indeed, that if the stately castle lacked all
other interest, a look over these grand woods, a fair stream consecrated by
the bard of Avon, richly cultivated gardens, and rare trees of prodigious size,
would amply compensate the visitor.</p>

<p>In the grounds are many charming objects and delicious spots, concerning
some of which the visitor, naturally, will desire information. Of these,
<span class="smcap">Cæsar’s Tower</span> is one of the most sadly interesting, from the fact that beneath
it is a dark and damp dungeon, in which many a sad heart has died out in
solitude. On the walls are some touching inscriptions and rude carvings done
by the miserable beings who have been incarcerated there. Among these the
following is specially curious:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">Ma<i>ʃ</i><span class="smcap">TER : Iohn : Sm</span>y<span class="smcap">th : Gvner : to : his :</span></p>

<p class="pn1">That was the last person known to have been confined in the dungeon.
Besides this, there are crosses, crucifixes, cross-bows, and other objects and
inscriptions traceable on the walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guy’s Tower</span> (to which we have alluded, and which forms our initial letter
on page 206) contains several rooms appropriated to various purposes. Its
summit is reached by a flight of 133 steps&mdash;a most fatiguing ascent, but amply
repaid by the magnificent panoramic view obtained from the battlements.
Hence “are seen the spires of the Coventry churches, the Castle of Kenilworth,
Guy’s Cliff, and Blacklow Hill; Grove Park, the seat of Lord Dormer; Shuckburgh
and the Shropshire Hills; the Saxon Tower on the Broadway Hills;
the fashionable spa of Leamington, which appears almost lying underneath
the feet, and the wide-extended park; while village churches, lifting up their
venerable heads from amidst embowering trees, fill up a picture pleasing, grand,
and interesting. In the various rooms will be noticed carvings and inscriptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
which possess interest. From the <span class="smcap">Bear Court</span> a portcullised doorway
in the north wall opens to the moat, across which is a bridge leading to the
pleasure-grounds and <span class="smcap">Conservatory</span>. In this is placed one of the wonders of
the “Stately Home”&mdash;the celebrated <i>Warwick Vase</i>, rescued from the bottom
of a lake at Adrian’s Villa, near Tivoli, by Sir William Hamilton, from whom
it was obtained by the late Earl of Warwick.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Porter’s Lodge</span> are preserved a number of relics, said to have
belonged to the “Renowned Guy”&mdash;but, as they represent so many periods,
they must have appertained to “Many Guys.” The articles shown are “Guy’s
Porridge-pot;” “Guy’s Sword,” for taking care of which William Hoggeson,
Yeoman of the Buttery, had a salary of 2<i>d.</i> a day, temp. H. VIII.; parts of his
armour, of which the “bascinet is of the time of Edward III.; and a breastplate
partly of the fifteenth century, and partly of the time of James I.; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
sword of the reign of Henry VIII.; the staff, an ancient tilting lance;” the
horse armour of the fifteenth century; the “flesh fork;” and other articles,
among which are his fair “Felicia’s slippers,” which are a pair of footed
stirrup-irons of the fifteenth century. The “rib of the dun cow,” and a joint
of the spine of the same, as well as the tusk and blade bone of a wild boar, are
also shown, and are still looked upon with wonder, as belonging to veritable
animals slain by Guy. There are also other “curiosities” shown in this lodge,
and visitors eagerly inspect them, often as greater attractions than matters
more worthy. Into the wild old legend connected with Guy, Earl of Warwick,
it is not necessary here to enter at length. It was a popular legend in the
Middle Ages, and his encounter with the Danish champion, Colbrand, as well
as his victory over the dun cow, was a favourite subject of the wandering
minstrel. Dugdale has given the narrative of his battle with Colbrand, which
he seems inclined to believe to be true in the main features, although “the
monks may have sounded out his praises hyperbolically.” According to him,
“in year three of King Athelstan, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 826, the Danes having invaded England,
cruelly wasted the countrys where they marcht, so that there was scarce a
town or castle that they had not burnt or destroyed almost as far as Winchester,”
where the king resided, and to whom they sent a message, requiring
him to resign his crown to their generals, holding his power at their hands,
and paying them yearly tribute for the privilege of ruling; or that the whole
dispute for the kingdom be determined in a single combat, by two champions
for both sides. The king having chosen the latter alternative, enjoins a fast
for three days, and, in great anguish of heart that Guy the famous warrior is
absent on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, prays Heaven for assistance. An
angel appears to the king as he is on his bed, and directs him to arise early
on the morrow, and take two bishops with him to the north gate of the city,
and stay there “till the hour of prime,” until the poor people and pilgrims
arrive, among whom he must choose a champion, and the choice must fall
upon him who goes barefooted, with a wreath of white roses on his head.
The king goes and meets the pilgrim, accosts him, and asks his championship,
which he hesitates to give, excusing himself on the ground of his weakness
with much travel, and exhorts him to seek fitter help. To this the king
bitterly answers, “I had but one valiant knight, which was Earl of Warwick,
called Guy, and he had a courageous servant, named Sir Heraud de Ardene;
would to God I had him here, for then should this duel be soon undertaken,
and the war finished; and as he spake these words, the tears fell from his
eyes.”</p>

</div>

<p>The pilgrim is moved, and ultimately consents, and after three weeks
spent in prayer and preparation the battle begins. Colbrand “came so
weightily harnessed, that his horse could scarcely carry him, and before him
a cart loaded with Danish axes, great clubs, with knobs of iron, squared bars
of steel, lances, and iron hooks, to pull his adversary to him.” The giant
uses a bar of steel in the combat, which lasts the whole day. Guy in the end
proving victorious, and taking a farewell of the king, to whom he declares
himself, goes towards Warwick, and thence to a hermit in its neighbourhood,
living with him till his death, and succeeding him in his cell until his own
decease.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The spot is still pointed out, and bears the name of Guy’s Cliff.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
But this is not the only giant-story connected with the family. Their well-known
crest, or cognisance, is said to come from one Morvidus, an Earl of
Warwick in the days of King Arthur, “who being a man of valour, slew a
mighty gyant in a single duell, which gyant encountered him with a young
tree pulled up by the root, the boughs being nog’d from it; in token whereof,
he and his successors, Earles of Warwick in the time of the Brittons, bore a
ragged staff of silver in a sable shield for their cognisance.” Other stories
are the combat and overcoming of the famous dun cow, the slaying of a
ferocious lion, and “the greatest boar that man e’er saw,” the killing of “the
mighty dragon in Northumberland that destroyed men, women, and children,”
and the killing of the fifteen armed knights. Such were the old fables with
which our ancient family histories were obscured, or rendered romantic and
wonderful to the subordinate classes.</p>

<p>Intimately connected with Warwick Castle and its former lords, is the
Beauchamp Chapel attached to St. Mary’s Church. The chapel is one of
the most exquisitely beautiful buildings remaining in this country, and ought
to be seen by every visitor to Warwick. It is placed on the south side of the
choir of the church, from which it is entered by a descent of several steps
beneath a doorway said to have been carved by a mason of Warwick in 1704,
but probably being only a freshening and touching up, or restoration, of the
original design. The size of the chapel is 58 feet in length, 25 in breadth,
and 32 in height, and its design and finish are of the most chaste and beautiful
and elaborate character. It was built in the reign of Henry VI., in accordance
with the will of its founder, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who
died in 1439. The foundation was laid in 1443, and in 1475 the chapel was
consecrated, and the body of its founder with much solemnity laid therein.
It is stated to have cost £2,481 4<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, an enormous sum in those days,
when the value of a fat ox was only 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>: and the contracts for some of
the work are still preserved. In the chapel is the monument of the founder,
which is, with only one exception, the most splendid monument of its kind in
the kingdom. It is an altar-tomb of Purbeck marble, bearing the recumbent
effigy of the great earl, in fine latten brass, gilt. His head, uncovered, rests
upon a helmet, and at his feet are a bear and a griffin. The tomb is surmounted
by one of the few “hearses” that yet remain in our churches. It
consists of six hoops of brass, extended by five transverse brass rods, on
which formerly was hung a pall, “to keep the figure reverently from the
dust.” Around the tomb, in niches, are fourteen figures in “divers vestures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
called weepers,” friends and relatives of the deceased who mourn his loss.
Between the weepers are smaller niches, raised upon pillars, containing whole-length
figures of angels holding scrolls, inscribed “Sit deo laus in gloria,
defunctis misericordia.” The effigy of the earl is the finest of its class, and
it is a perfect figure, the armour on the back, and all the details being as
highly and carefully finished as those on the front of the figure. For this
effigy in brass, William Austen was paid (exclusive of cost of workmen,
carriage, &amp;c.) £40, and the goldsmith, Bartholomew Lambespring, was paid
£13 for gilding it; the “weepers” cost in brass, 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> each, and the angels
5<i>s.</i> each; and the gilding of these, and preparing them for gilding, cost also a
considerable sum&mdash;the contracts being of the highest interest, and very minute
in every particular.</p>

<p>In the same chapel are monuments, &amp;c., to Robert Dudley, Earl of

<p>The Church of St. Mary is of considerable antiquity, and is mentioned in
Domesday Book. The Norman Earl, Henry de Newburgh, formed the intention
of uniting the endowments of St. Nicholas within the Castle with
St. Mary’s, which was carried out by his son, whose grant of incorporation
was executed in 1123. Probably the church was built about that time, as the
crypt is of Norman character. In the reign of Edward III., Thomas Beauchamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
ordained by his will in 1369, that a choir should be erected; and many
alterations have at one time or other been made. A great part of the church
was burnt down in 1694, and rebuilt at a cost of £5,000, to which Queen
Anne contributed £1,000. In the crypt is preserved the ducking stool.</p>

<p>It is desirable to add a word or two concerning “Guy’s Cave” and the
“Statue of Guy” at Guy’s Cliff, to which the visitor ought by all means to
“wend his way.” Indeed, the town of Warwick, and the whole of the
neighbourhood by which it is surrounded, is one grand assemblage of
interesting objects, of which the mind cannot tire or become satiated. To
all we have described&mdash;the towers, the lodges, the several apartments of the
castle, and to the gardens and grounds&mdash;the publicly is freely, graciously, and
generously admitted: a boon for which we are sure every visitor will be
grateful.</p>

<p>One of the few remaining “antiques” that yet endure to the town we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
have selected for engraving&mdash;the <span class="smcap">East Gate</span>; but, as will be seen, the base
only can be considered ancient; it has been “transmogrified,” yet is still
striking and interesting. The Earl of Leicester’s Hospital, founded by Robert
Dudley in 1586, is a singularly beautiful and perfect specimen of the half-timber
houses; it escaped the great fire that nearly destroyed the town in
1694. There are not many other ancient edifices in the venerable town.</p>

<p>Thus, it will be readily understood that a day at Warwick supplies a rare
treat; not only to the antiquary, and the historian, but to the lover of
nature. The best views of the Castle are obtained from the opposite side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of the Avon, near a narrow stream crossed by a bridge, which is part of the
main road;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> of the old bridge there are some remains, rendered highly picturesque
by ivy and lichens that grow in profusion there, and near the old
mill, the date of which is coeval with that of the Castle. Superb trees grow in
the immediate grounds, huge chestnuts and gigantic cedars, that have sheltered
the stout earls time out of mind: the walls are grey with age; but it is a sober
livery that well suits the stronghold of the bold barons, and suggests the tranquillity
of repose after the fever of battles, sieges, and deeds that cannot fail to
be summoned from history as one looks from the filled-up moat to the towers
and battlements that still smile or frown upon the environing town they controlled
or protected.</p>

<p>It demands but little imagination to carry the visitor of to-day back
through long-past centuries, from the moment we enter the picturesque yet
gloomy passage cut through the rock, covered with ivy, lichens, and wild
flowers in rich abundance, and pass under the portcullis that yet frowns above
the porter’s lodge: the whole seems so little changed by time, that one might
wait for the king-maker and his mighty host to issue through the gateway,
and watch the red rose or the white rose on the helmets of attendant knights;
by no great stretch of fancy one might see the trembling Gaveston, the petted
minion of a weak monarch, dragged forth to death: a hundred events or
incidents are associated with these courts and towers, inseparably linked with
British history; and it is impossible to resist a feeling of reverence approaching
awe while pacing peacefully among them.</p>

<p>The “frowning keep,” nearly hidden by the green foliage of surrounding
trees, may be accepted as an emblem of the Castle; where tranquillity and
peace are in the stead of fierceness and broil. Warwick, while it has lost
little of its grandeur, has obtained much of grace from time; Time which</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Moulders into beauty many a tower,<br />
That when it frowned with all its battlements<br />
Was only terrible.”</p>

</div>
<p class="dc10 p3">HADDON HALL is, perhaps, the most interesting,
and is certainly the most attractive,
of all the ancient mansions of England: and
none have been so fertile of material to
Artists. Situate in one of the most picturesque,
if not the most beautiful, of our
English shires, absolutely perfect as an
example of the Baronial Halls of our ancestors,
and easily accessible by charming
routes from populous towns, it is not surprising
that it should be visited annually by
tens of thousands; and that in America it is
regarded as one of the places in the “Old
Country,” which no visitors, even of a week,
to the classic land of their History, should
neglect to see, examine, and describe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Haddon Hall</span> is distant fourteen miles
from <span class="smcap">Buxton</span>; perhaps the most fashionable, as it certainly
is one of the most cheerful, and, we believe, the most healthful
of all the Baths of England. Its waters are as efficacious, in
certain ailments, as are those of Southern Germany; while
the surrounding district is so grand and beautiful, so happily
mingling the sublime and the graceful, as to compete, and
by no means unfavourably, with the hills and valleys that
border the distant Rhine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The poet, the novelist, the traveller, the naturalist, the sportsman, and the
antiquary have found appropriate themes in Derbyshire, in its massive rocks&mdash;“Tors”&mdash;and
deep dells; its pasture-lands on mountain-slopes; its rapid,
yet never broad, rivers&mdash;delights of the angler; its crags and caves; its
rugged and ragged or wooded steeps; above all, its relics of the earlier days
when Briton, Roman, Saxon, and Norman, held alternate sway over the rich
lands and prolific mines of this lavishly endowed county; and of a later time,
when shrewd monks planted themselves beside the clear streams and rich
meadows, to which they bequeathed magnificent ruins to tell of intellectual
and material power in the time of their vigorous and prosperous strength.</p>

<p>Unequivocal evidence exists that the Romans knew the curative properties
of the Baths at Buxton; and it is almost certain, from the many Celtic barrows
and stone circles found in the neighbourhood, that a still earlier race was
acquainted with them. Probably, therefore, for more than a thousand years
Buxton has been one of the principal “health-resorts” of this island. Yet
few remains of antiquity exist in the town. The dwelling&mdash;in which was
lodged Mary, Queen of Scots, on her several visits, while in custody of the
Earl of Shrewsbury, and to which “good Queen Bess,” while sojourning at
Kenilworth, sent the Earl of Leicester, that he might drink of the healing
waters, “twenty days together”&mdash;was removed just a century ago: a handsome
and very commodious hotel occupies the site: it is still called the “Old
Hall;” and immediately behind it are the two springs&mdash;the Saline and the
Iron&mdash;the Chalybeate and the Tonic. On a window-pane of one of the rooms
in this Old Hall, Mary, Queen of Scots, is said to have scratched the following
touching and kindly farewell&mdash;the pane of glass having been preserved until
recent years:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Buxtona, quæ calidæ celebrare nomine lymphæ,<br />
Forte mihi posthac non adeunda vale!”</p>

<p class="p1">Cheerfulness is the handmaid of health: and, although there are many
patients in and about Buxton, they do not seem to suffer much: there are
more smiles than moans in the pump-room; and rheumatism is not a disease
that makes much outer show of anguish.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find in any part of the British dominions a drive so
grandly beautiful as that between Buxton and Haddon. Within half a mile of
its centre is “the Duke’s Drive” (formed in 1795 by the then Duke of
Devonshire): it runs through Ashwood Dale, Miller’s Dale, and Monsal Dale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
passing “the Lover’s Leap” and “Chee Tor”&mdash;stupendous crags, from the
crevices of which grow small trees, partially crowned and covered with ivy,
ferns, and lichens, groups of varied foliage intervening; with here and there
umbrageous woods; and the river Wye&mdash;not the “sylvan Wye, thou wanderer
through the woods,” of Wordsworth, but its namesake of lesser fame, that has
its source a mile or two north of Buxton&mdash;journeying all the way, until at
Rowsley it joins the Derwent (not the Derwent of the English lakes), from
whence the blended waters, running by Matlock, Belper, and Derby, flow into
the Trent, and so make their way to the sea.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Haddon, from the Meadows on the Bakewell Road.</i></p>
</div>

<p>To give a list of the several objects that delight the eye and mind during
this comparatively short drive, would fill more pages than we have at our
disposal. The lowest part of the town of Buxton is one thousand feet above the
level of the sea; the naturalist, the botanist, and the geologist will find treasure-troves
in any of the surrounding hills and valleys: while natural marvels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
abound, within a few miles, in all directions&mdash;such as Poole’s Hole, the Blue-John
Mine, the Ebbing and Flowing Well, and the Peak Cavern, with its
summit crowned by the fine old castle of “Peveril of the Peak.” Majestic
Chatsworth&mdash;to which, on certain days, the people are admitted, the park
being at all times freely open to all comers&mdash;is distant about three miles from
Haddon, across Manners Wood and intervening hills: in short, there are a
hundred places of deep interest within a drive of Buxton, and, if it be a long
drive, Dovedale&mdash;the loveliest dale in England&mdash;is easily reached; so, indeed,
is far-famed Alton Towers.</p>

<p>From Manchester and Buxton the way to Haddon is through the ancient
town of Bakewell, to the venerable parish church of which we shall, in due
course, conduct the reader&mdash;for it contains the monuments of <span class="smcap">the Vernons</span>.
But before entering the old Hall, we must ask the reader to glance at another
route to Haddon&mdash;that which he will probably take if his tour be made direct
from London.</p>

<p>No doubt many visitors to Haddon will start from <span class="smcap">Derby</span>; and if the road
from Buxton is charming, so also is that from the capital of the shire: it is
more open; the vales are wider; the views are more extensive; there are the
same attractions of hill and dell and rock and river; cottages embosomed in
foliage; church steeples seen among richly-clad trees; clean and happy-looking
villages; and distant towns, never indicated, except in one case&mdash;that
of Belper&mdash;by the chimneys and sullen shadows of manufactories. For more
than twenty miles there is an unbroken continuation of scenic loveliness, such
as, in its calm and quiet charm, its simple grace, and all the attractions of
home nature, can be found nowhere else in the wide world.</p>

<p>Leaving Derby, and passing by the famous “Boar’s Head” cotton manufactory
of Messrs. Evans on the left, and Breadsall on the right, the first
station arrived at is Duffield, a delightful village, where was once the castle
of the Peverels, and so on to Belper, famous for its cotton mills of the Messrs.
Strutt; thence through a delightful country to the pleasant Junction of
Ambergate, from whence the railway runs by the picturesque village of Cromford,
the creation of one great man, Sir Richard Arkwright; Matlock Bath,
the most popular and beautiful of inland watering-places, whose villa residences
peep out from the heights in every direction, and whose “High Tor” frowns
down upon the railway beneath; Matlock Bridge, whose hill-side of Matlock
Bank is studded with famous hydropathic establishments; and Darley Dale,
with its fine old church, and grand old yew tree, the largest in the kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
until the train stops at Rowsley. Here the passenger for Haddon, or Chatsworth,
will alight, and here he will find conveyances, should he care to ride
on. Here too he will find a pleasant hostel, “The Peacock,” in which to
refresh the inner man.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Peacock at Rowsley.</i></p>
</div>

<p>“The Peacock” at Rowsley is one of the prettiest and pleasantest inns in
“all England:” it has ever been in high favour with “brethren of the
angle”&mdash;long before the neat and graceful railway station stood so near it
that the whistle of the train is audible a dozen times a day, and twice or
thrice at night. The fine old bridge close at hand throws its arches across
the Derwent; neatly and gracefully trimmed gardens skirt the banks of that
clear and bright river, into which flows the Wye about a furlong off; and
rivers, meadows, rocks and dells, and hills and valleys “all round about,”
exhibit to perfection the peculiarities of the vale, so rich in the beautiful and
the picturesque. “The Peacock” is the nearest inn to Haddon; and here
hundreds of travellers from all parts of the world have found not only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
tranquil resting-place, but a cheerful home.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> We have thought it well to
picture it, and have placed at its doors one of the waggonettes that drive
hither and thither from Buxton and other places; and the tourist may rest
assured that this pretty inn is indeed a place at which he may “rest, and be
thankful.”</p>

<p>At Rowsley the tourist is but three miles from Chatsworth, and two miles
from Haddon. A pleasant walk through the valley brings him in sight of
Haddon Hall; and from this road he obtains, perhaps, the best view of it.
Partly hidden, as it is, by tall and full-leaved trees, its grandeur is not at once
apparent; but the impression deepens as he ascends the steep pathway and
pauses before the nail-studded door that opens into the court-yard.</p>

<p>Before we proceed to describe the <span class="smcap">Hall</span>, however, we shall give some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
accounts of its earlier owners&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Vernons</span>&mdash;reserving for an after-part the
history of their successors, the illustrious family of <span class="smcap">Manners</span>, from their origin,
as knights, to the period of their high elevation, as Earls and Dukes of
Rutland, and so down to the present time.</p>

<p>The history of Haddon, unlike that of most of our ancient baronial
residences, has always been one of peace and hospitality, not of war and feud
and oppression; and however much its owners may, at one period or other,
have been mixed up in the stirring events of the ages in which they lived,
Haddon itself has taken no part in the turmoils. It has literally been a
stronghold: but it has been the stronghold of home and domestic life, not of
armed strife.</p>

</div>
<p class="dc20 p2">HADDON, at the time of taking the Domesday
survey, when the manor of Bakewell belonged
to, and was held by, the king, was a berewite
of the manor; and there one carucate of land
was claimed by Henry de Ferrars. Over-Haddon,
a village two or three miles off, on the hills, was
also another berewite of the same manor. To
whom Haddon belonged in the Saxon period is
not clear; the first owner of which there is any
distinct knowledge is this Henry de Ferrars, who
held it in 1086, and who, by grant of the Conqueror,
had no less than 114 manors in Derbyshire
alone; he built Duffield Castle, and founded the
Church of the Holy Trinity, near the Castle of
Tutbury.</p>

<p>Haddon was at a very early period held, it is
said, by tenure of knight’s service, by William
Avenell, who resided there, and was possessed of
much land in the neighbourhood. Soon after the
foundation of Roche Abbey, in 1147, William de
Avenell, Lord of Haddon, gave to that establishment
the grange of Oneash and its appurtenances. One
of the daughters and co-heiresses of William de
Avenell, Elizabeth, married Simon Bassett, of the
fine old family of Bassett, owners of much property in this and the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
counties; the other married Richard de Vernon; and thus Haddon
passed into that noted family, of which we proceed to give some particulars.</p>

<p>The House of Vernon is of very considerable antiquity, and derives its
name, as do many others in the Baronage of England, from its primitive
domicile in Normandy&mdash;the <i>Châtellenie</i> of Vernon, forming one of the territorial
subdivisions of that country: the castle, with its hereditary lords, is
recorded in the Anglo-Norman chronicles. According to the present territorial
division of France, Vernon is a commune in the <i>Département de l’Eure</i> and
<i>Arrondissement d’Evreux</i>; and as being the <i>chef-lieu</i>, gives name to the canton
in which it is situate. From this locality, one of the most picturesque and
luxuriant of the vine districts, the family of Vernon takes its origin; and also
the ancient family of De Redvers&mdash;the two families, indeed, being originally
identical, the name of De Redvers having been assumed by a Vernon in the
eleventh century, from the place of his residence, Révière, in Normandy: his
family were “Comtes de Révières and Vernon, and Barons de Néhou;” both
families tracing from the d’Ivry stock. Mauriscus d’Ivry (father of Robert
d’Ivry), who was father of Alselin Goël&mdash;the names of whose sons, Roger
Pincerna, surnamed “the stammerer,” Lord of the Castle of Grossœuvre;
William Lupellus (Lovel), who acquired the castle of Ivry on the death of his
elder brother; and Robert Goël&mdash;are well known in history; the one as
holding the Honour of Ivry in right of his descent from Count Ralph, uterine-brother
of Richard I., Duke of Normandy; another as the founder of the
family of Lovel; and the third as having held his castle of Grossœuvre against
King Stephen; he had a son, Baldwin, who took the surname of De Revers
from the place of his residence: and two generations later, William, the son
of Richard, assumed the name of Vernon, from the <i>Châtellenie</i> of that name
which he held. His son, Hugh de Revers, or Vernon, usually called Hugh de
Monachus, had a son, William de Vernon, Lord of Vernon, who founded the
Abbey of Montebourg. By his wife Emma he had issue two sons, Walter
and Richard: the latter of whom, Richard de Redvers (as the name became
afterwards spelled), or Vernon, came over at the Conquest, and was created
Baron of Shipbroke in Cheshire. He married Adeliza, daughter of William
Peverel of Nottingham, and received with her in frank-marriage&mdash;that is, a free
gift of an estate given with a wife on her marriage, and descendable to their
joint heirs&mdash;the manor of Wolleigh, Buckinghamshire. One of these sons,
Baldwin de Redvers, was created Earl of Devon, and from him descended the
line of earls of that name; while William de Redvers, who inherited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Norman baronies of Vernon, Révières, and Néhou, re-assumed the surname of
Vernon from those possessions. He had an only son and heir, Hugh de
Vernon, Baron of Shipbroke, who married a daughter of Raynold Badgioll,
Lord of Erdiswicke and Holgrave. By this lady he had a numerous issue:
the eldest, Warin, continuing the barony of Shipbroke; Matthew, inheriting
the lordships of Erdeswicke and Holgrave, who was ancestor of the Vernons
of those places, and Richard, already alluded to. This Richard de Vernon
married Avice, the daughter and co-heiress of William de Avenell, Lord of
Haddon; his other daughter and co-heiress marrying Sir Simon Bassett. By
marriage with this lady Richard de Vernon acquired Haddon and other estates,
and thus became settled at Haddon Hall. He had issue, an only daughter
and heiress, who married Gilbert le Francis; and their son, Richard le
Francis, took the name of Vernon, on coming into the property, and settled
at Haddon. He married Mary, daughter of Robert, Baron of Stockport. His
descendant, Sir Richard Vernon, Lord of Haddon and of Appleby, &amp;c., married
Maude, daughter and co-heiress of William de Camville, by whom he had an
only son and heir, William Vernon, who was only ten years of age at his
father’s death in 1422, when he was found heir to his grandfather. In 1330
he obtained a grant of free warren, or the exclusive right of killing beasts and
birds of warren within prescribed limits in the royal forests, &amp;c., from the
king. He married Joan, daughter of Rhee, or Rhis, ap Griffith, and heiress
of Richard Stackpole, and had issue by her Sir Richard Vernon, Knt., of
Pembrugge (sometimes called Sir Richard de Pembrugge), Lord of Haddon
and Tonge, which latter lordship he acquired by his marriage with the sister
and heiress of Sir Fulke de Pembrugge, or Pembridge, Lord of Tonge in
Shropshire. Their son, Richard Vernon, was father of Richard Vernon,
Treasurer of Calais, Captain of Rouen, and Speaker in the Parliament at
Leicester in 1426. By his wife, Benedict, daughter of St. John Ludlow of
Hodnet, he had issue, with others, Sir William Vernon, Knt., who, marrying
Margaret, daughter of Sir Robert Pype of Spernore, acquired that manor and
lordship. He was buried at Tonge, where a monument was placed to his
memory.</p>

<p>His son, or grandson, Sir Henry Vernon, was made governor to Prince
Arthur by King Henry VII., with whom he was a great favourite. He
married Anne, daughter of John, second Earl of Shrewsbury, by Elizabeth
Butler, daughter of James, Earl of Ormond. By this marriage he had issue,
Sir Henry Vernon, who was made High Steward of the King’s Forest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Peak by Henry VIII., and held many other posts. He had issue, two sons,
Sir George Vernon and Sir John Vernon. Sir Henry died in 1515, and
was succeeded by his oldest son, Sir George, “the King of the Peak,” who
succeeded to the Haddon and other estates, as will presently be shown.</p>

</div>

<p>Sir John Vernon, Knt., married Helen, daughter and co-heiress of John
Montgomery, of Sudbury, in Derbyshire, with whom he received the Sudbury
and other estates, and thus founded the family of Lords Vernon. He was one
of the King’s Council in Wales, and Custos Rotulorum of Derbyshire, and
dying in 1540, was buried at Clifton Camville. He was succeeded by his son,
Henry Vernon, who, in his turn, was succeeded by his son, John Vernon, who
married Mary, widow of Walter Vernon, of Houndhill, and daughter of Sir
Edward Littleton, of Pillaton Hall, by whom, however, he had no issue. On
his death in 1600, the estates passed to his stepson, Edward Vernon, the eldest
son of his wife by her former husband, the family consisting of three surviving
sons&mdash;Edward, Thomas, and Walter&mdash;and four daughters. By this lady, while
a second time a widow, Sudbury Hall is said to have been erected. Edward
Vernon was succeeded by his son, Henry Vernon, who married the sole
daughter of Sir George Vernon, of Haslington, in
Cheshire, and by her had issue a son, George,
who succeeded him. This George Vernon was
thrice married: first to Margaret, daughter of
Edward Onely, by whom he had no issue; and,
third, to Catherine, daughter of Sir Thomas Vernon,
Knt., merchant, of London. By this lady he had
a numerous family, and was succeeded by his eldest
and sole-surviving son and heir, Henry Vernon, who
married, first, Anne, sole daughter of Thomas Pigott, Esq., and heiress of her
mother, who was sister and sole heiress of Peter Venables, last Baron
Kinderton; and, second, Matilda, daughter of Thomas Wright, Esq., of
Longston. Henry Vernon, who thus inherited the estates of the Venables,
assumed that surname in addition to his own. He had issue by his first wife,
among others, a son, George Venables-Vernon, by whom he was succeeded.
George Venables-Vernon married three times. By his first wife, the Hon.
Mary Howard, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Howard, sixth Lord
Howard of Effingham, he had issue a son, the second Lord Vernon, and
a daughter, Mary, married to George Anson, of Orgrave, the father of the
first Viscount Anson. By his second wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Lee, he had no issue; but by his third wife, Martha, sister to Simon
Harcourt, first Earl Harcourt, he had a numerous family, as will be
shown. This George Venables-Vernon was created Baron Vernon of Kinderton
in 1762, and at his death was succeeded in his titles and estates by the
eldest son of his first marriage, George Venables-Vernon, as second Lord
Vernon, who married, first, the Hon. Louisa Barbarina, daughter of Bussey,
Lord Mansell, by whom he had an only daughter, who died unmarried; and,
second, to Georgiana, daughter of William Fanquier, Esq., by whom he had
also an only daughter, Georgiana, married to Lord Suffield. His lordship was
succeeded in title and estates by his brother, the Hon. Henry Vernon, as third
Lord Vernon. This nobleman&mdash;whose brother Edward took the surname of
Harcourt, and became Archbishop of York, and one of whose sisters, as has
been shown, married the father of the first Viscount Anson, and another,
Elizabeth, became the wife of George Simon, second Lord Harcourt&mdash;married
twice. By his first wife, Elizabeth Rebecca Anne, daughter of Charles
Sedley, Esq., of Nuttall, his lordship had issue two daughters (one of whom
the Hon. Catherine, died unmarried; and the other, the Hon. Louisa Henrietta,
married the Rev. Brooke Boothby, Prebendary of Southwell) and one son,
George Charles Venables-Vernon, who succeeded him as fourth Lord Vernon.
This nobleman married, in 1802, Frances Maria, daughter and heiress of Sir
John Borlase Warren, Bart., K.B., of Stapleford, by whom he had issue the
Hon. George John Venables-Vernon, fifth Lord Vernon, who assumed the
surname of Warren by sign manual in 1837, for himself and the children only
who should be born after that date. His lordship married twice: first to
Isabella Caroline, eldest daughter of Cuthbert Ellison, Esq., M.P., by whom he
had issue the present Lord Vernon, and the Hon. William John Borlase Warren
Venables-Vernon (who assumed the additional surname of Warren), and three
daughters; and second, in 1859, his cousin, Frances Maria Emma, daughter of
the Rev. Brooke Boothby, who still survives him, without issue. Lord Vernon,
as the Hon. George John Vernon, was M.P. for Derbyshire from 1830 until, on
the death of his father, he entered the Upper House. He was one of the most
energetic supporters of the rifle movement, being himself the most skilful rifle-shooter
of his day, carrying off the principal prizes at the various Swiss Tirs, as
well as elsewhere. As a scholar his lordship ranked very high, and the “Dante,”
edited by him, is the most sumptuous work of its kind ever attempted. Lord
Vernon died in 1866, and was succeeded by his eldest son, the Hon. Augustus
Henry Venables-Vernon, as sixth Lord Vernon, the present peer, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
born in Rome in 1829, and was Captain in the Scots Fusilier Guards, and
Captain Commandant of the Second Battalion of Derbyshire Rifle Volunteers.
His lordship married, in 1851, Lady Hariet Anson, daughter of the Earl of
Lichfield, by whom he has issue two sons and four daughters.</p>

<p>Having now shown the descent of the Lords Vernon from the old lords of
Haddon, we return to the “King of the Peak”&mdash;Sir George Vernon&mdash;and his
heiresses. He, as has been stated, succeeded to the estates in 1515, and at
the time of his death, in 1567, was possessed of no fewer than thirty manors
in Derbyshire alone. He was married twice: first, to Margaret, daughter of
Sir Gilbert Taylebois, Knt.; and, secondly, to Maude, daughter of Sir Ralph
Langford. He had issue, two daughters, his co-heiresses, Margaret and
Dorothy, whose husbands inherited his immense possessions. Margaret
Vernon married Sir Thomas Stanley, Knt., of Winwick, in Lancashire, second
son of Edward Stanley, third Earl of Derby; and Dorothy Vernon, whose
name has become “a household word” in this locality, married Sir John
Manners, Knt., second son of Thomas Manners, first Earl of Rutland, and
direct ancestor of the present Duke of Rutland. To this branch we shall
presently have to refer at greater length.</p>

<p>Sir George Vernon lived at Haddon in such a style of princely magnificence
and hospitality as to earn for himself the title of “King of the Peak.”
It is said that he was generous and hospitable, as well one of as just and
strict, of men, although given perhaps to undue severity and to an indulgence
in “Lynch law;” and that he lived and died in the “good esteem” of all men.</p>

<p>One tradition, briefly told, will sufficiently illustrate the firmness and
decision of his character, and the power he held over the actions and even the
lives of the people around him. It is related that a pedlar who had been hawking
his wares in the neighbourhood was found murdered in a lonely spot. He
had been seen the evening before to enter a cottage, and never afterwards seen
alive. As soon as Sir George became aware of the fact of the crime having been
committed, he had the body of the pedlar removed to Haddon, laid in the hall,
and covered with a sheet. He then sent for the cottager to come immediately,
and, on his arrival, at once questioned him as to where the pedlar was who
was seen to enter his house the night before. The man denied having seen
him or knowing anything about him; when Sir George uncovered the body
before him, ordering that all persons present should touch the body in succession,
at the same time declaring their innocence of the murder. The suspected
man, when his turn came, declined to touch the body, and instantly rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
out of the Hall, and made his way, “as fast as his legs could carry him,”
through Bakewell and towards Ashford. Sir George instantly ordered his
men to mount and follow him, and to hang him wherever they caught him.
The murderer was caught in a field opposite the present toll-bar at Ashford,
and at once hanged, and the field still bears the name of the “Gallows Acre,”
or “Galley Acre.” Sir George is said to have been cited to London for this
extraordinary piece of Lynch law, and when he appeared in court he was
summoned twice to surrender as “the King of the Peak.” To these he made
no reply, and the third time he was called on as Sir George Vernon, when he
stepped forward and acknowledged himself&mdash;“Here am I!” Having been
summoned as “the King of the Peak,” the indictment fell through, and Sir
George was admonished and discharged. Sir George Vernon is buried in
Bakewell Church, where a remarkably fine and well-preserved altar-tomb bears
the recumbent effigies of himself and his two wives.</p>

<p>Dorothy Vernon, the youngest daughter and co-heiress of Sir George, and
over whom such “a halo of romantic interest” rests, is said to have been one
of the most beautiful of all beautiful women, and possessed of so sweet a
temper, that she was idolised by all who knew her. If it were so, however,
the monument at Bakewell does not fairly represent her, for it exhibits her
with an expression of countenance far from either amiable or attractive. The
story of her life, according to popular belief, is that, while her elder sister,
fortunate in an open attachment to Sir Thomas Stanley, the son of the Earl of
Derby, and his affianced bride, was petted and “made much of,” she, the
younger, was kept in the background, having formed a secret attachment to
John Manners, son of the Earl of Rutland&mdash;an attachment which was opposed
by her father, sister, and stepmother; she was, therefore, closely watched, and
kept almost a prisoner. Her lover is said to have disguised himself as a woodman,
or forester, and to have remained in hiding in the woods around Haddon
for several weeks, in order to obtain stolen glances of, and occasional brief
meetings with, Dorothy. At length, on a festive night at Haddon&mdash;tradition
states it to have been on one of the “merry meetings,” consequent on the marriage
of her sister Margaret&mdash;Dorothy is said to have stolen away unobserved
in the midst of the merriment in the ball-room, and to have quietly passed
out of the door of the adjoining ante-room on to the terrace, which she crossed,
and having ascended the steps on the other side, her lover’s arms received
her; horses were in waiting, and they rode off in the moonlight all through
the night, and were married in Leicestershire the next morning. The door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
through which the heiress eloped is always pointed out to visitors as “Dorothy
Vernon’s Door.”</p>

<p>Thus the Derbyshire estates of Sir George Vernon passed to John Manners,
and thus it was the noble house of Rutland became connected with Haddon
and the county of Derby.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Haddon: from the Meadows.</i></p>
</div>

<p>John Manners, the husband of Dorothy Vernon, was knighted shortly after
his marriage. They had issue three sons: Sir George Manners, who succeeded
to the estates; John Manners, who died in 1590, aged 14; and Sir Roger
Manners of Whitwell, who died in 1650; also one daughter, Grace, who
became the wife of Sir Francis Fortescue. Dorothy died in 1584, and her
husband in 1611. They were both buried in Bakewell Church, where their
monument will no doubt be looked upon with interest by all visitors to the
district.</p>

<p>Haddon continued to be one of the residences of this branch of the Manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
family, ennobled in 1641 by the inheritance of the Rutland peerage, until they
quitted it in the early part of the last century for Belvoir Castle, of which we
shall, on a future occasion, take note.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Main Entrance.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hall</span> stands on a natural elevation&mdash;a platform of limestone&mdash;above
the eastern bank of the Wye: the river is crossed by a pretty, yet venerable,
bridge, passing which, we are at the foot of the rock, immediately fronting the
charming cottage which is the lodge of the custodian who keeps the keys.
In the garden we make our first acquaintance with the boar’s head and the
peacock&mdash;shaped from growing yew-trees&mdash;the crests of the families whose
dwelling we are about to enter. This cottage adjoins the old stables; their
antiquity is denoted by several sturdy buttresses. To the right of the great
entrance-door are the steps&mdash;placed there long ago&mdash;to assist ladies in mounting
their steeds, when ladies used to travel sitting on a pillion behind the
rider: the custom is altogether gone out; but in our younger days, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
did the farmer’s wife thus journey to market, but dames of distinction often
availed themselves of that mode of visiting, carrying hood and farthingale,
and hoop also, in leathern panniers at their sides, and jewels for ornament in
caskets on their laps.</p>

<p>The visitor now stands before the old gateway, with its massive nail-studded
door, and will note the noble flight of freestone steps, where time and
use have left the marks of frequent footsteps. Indeed, the top step&mdash;just
opposite the small entrance wicket in the larger door&mdash;is actually worn through
in the shape of a human foot. He will also notice the extreme beauty and
elegance of design of the Gothic architecture of this part of the building, and
the heraldic bearings with which it is decorated. Beneath the entrance archway
on the right is the guard-room of the “sturdy porter” of old times: his
“peep-hole” is still there, the framework of his bedstead, and the fire-place
that gave him comfort when keeping watch and ward.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-236.jpg" width="150" height="221" id="a236"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>After mounting the inner steps, the visitor passes into the first court-yard,
and will not fail to notice the remarkable character of
the splaying and chamfering of the building in the
angle over the inner archway. This is one of the most
remarkable features of the building. Its strange character
is to some extent occasioned by the winding of
a double spiral stone staircase, leading to the tower
over the entrance archway. The inside of this gateway,
with the enormous hoop, said to have been the
hoop of a mash-tub, hanging on the wall, is shown in
our vignette.</p>

<p>We are now in the lower court-yard, and at once
perceive that Haddon consists of two court-yards, or
quadrangles, with buildings surrounding each. Immediately opposite the gateway
are the stone steps that lead to the state apartments; to the right is the
chapel, and to the left, the <span class="smcap">Hall</span> proper, with its minstrels’ gallery and other
objects of curious&mdash;some of unique interest. The general arrangement will be
best understood by the ground-plan, which, however, requires some explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-237.jpg" width="400" height="661" id="a237"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>On account of the abruptness of the slope on which Haddon is built, it
stands so unevenly, that a horizontal line drawn from the ground in the
archway under the Peverel Tower would pass <i>over</i> the entrance archway.
Consequently, that archway, the porter’s lodge, and entrance to the spiral
staircase on its right hand, and on the left the two rooms entered from the
walk behind the partition wall, and before mounting the steps, form what
may, looking at it in that light, be called a basement story, to which also
belongs the cellar, entered by a flight of fourteen steps descending from the
buttery. Lysons, in his “Magna Britannia,” vol. v., engraves&mdash;first, a basement
plan, comprising the entrance archway and the low rooms above alluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to; second, a ground plan; third, a plan of the upper floor, including the
ball-room and other state rooms; and the numerous bed-rooms and other
apartments on the north and west sides. These plans are extremely correct
and minute: it transpires from letters in the Lysons’ correspondence (Addit.
MS. 9,423, British Museum), that they were made by the surveyor of the then
duke, to illustrate a little privately printed account of Haddon, written by himself,
and were lent to Lysons for his work by D’Ewes Coke, Esq., barrister-at-law,
then steward to the duke. The designations given by Lysons to the
apartments are therefore probably correct. From his lists, and a curious catalogue
of the apartments at Haddon, date 1666, we gather the general inference
that the rooms on the west side of the lower court were, in the latter days of
its occupation, occupied by the officials of the household; those on the entire
south side were the state rooms; those on the east side of the upper court
were the family apartments&mdash;the bed-rooms extending down to the intersection
of the lower court; those over the front archway, &amp;c., were the nursery
apartments; and the library is believed to have occupied the rooms between
these and the entrance tower.</p>

<p>There are second-floor apartments, not planned in Lysons, over the Peverel
Tower and its adjoining rooms, and over one half of the north side, from that
tower to the junction of the courts. Also solitary second-floor rooms in the
Entrance Tower, Central Tower, and over the staircase leading to the ball-room.
There is but one third-floor room, it is in the Eagle Tower, and is the
highest apartment in the Hall.</p>

<p>The plan we engrave will be found the most useful to visitors. It gives
the ground-plan irrespective of levels (which would only be bewildering to the
visitor), with the exception of the slightly elevated ball-room and state-rooms
in the upper court-yard. In fact, from even these being entered from the
terrace, the whole of the plan we have prepared may, for <i>general</i> purposes, be
said to be that of the ground-floor.</p>

<p>On the east side there are but slight differences between the ground-floor
and first-floor rooms, excepting those over the kitchen and adjoining offices,
and over the central archway. On the south side the differences are material.
The ball-room covers six ground-floor cellar rooms. The drawing-room is
over the dining-room; and the earl’s bed-chamber and other rooms are over
the long narrow ground-floor passages between that and the chapel. On the
west side also the arrangement differs considerably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Some portions of the building are of undoubted Norman origin, and it is
not unlikely that even they were grafted on a Saxon erection. Norman
remains will be noticed in the chapel, and, therefore, it is certain that that
portion of the building, as well as others which could be pointed out, are the
same as when the place was owned by the Peverels and Avenells. Before the
year 1199, John, Earl of Morteigne, afterwards King John, by writ directed
to his justices, sheriffs, bailiffs, ministers, and all his lieges, granted a licence
to Richard de Vernon to fortify his house of Haddon with a wall to the height
of twelve feet, without kernel (or <i>crenelle</i>, which was an open parapet or
battlement with embrasures or loopholes to shoot through), and forbidding
his being disturbed in so doing. This interesting licence, now in possession
of the Duke of Rutland, is as follows:&mdash;“Johannes com. Moret. justic. vice-com.
baillivis, ministris, et omnibus fidelibus suis salutem. Sciatis me concessisse
et licenciam dedisse Ric. de Vern. firmandi domum suum de Heddon,
muro exaltato xij pedibus sine kernello, et idem prohibeo nequis vestrum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
eum inde disturbet. Test. Rob. de Mara apud Clipeston.” It is endorsed
“Breve patens Com. Johannis.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Gateway under the Eagle Tower.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The earliest portions of the buildings of Haddon now remaining appear to
be a part of the chapel, and lower portions of the walls of the south front and
of the north-east tower. To the next period, from 1300 to about 1380
(according to Duesbury), belong the hall-porch, the magnificent kitchen and
adjoining offices, the great or banqueting hall, the lower west window of the
chapel, part of the north-east tower, and part of the cellarage under the long
gallery. In the third period, from about 1380 to 1470, were added the east,
and part of the west end of the chapel, and the remaining buildings on the
east side of the upper court-yard. The fourth period, from 1470 to 1530,
comprises the fittings and interior finishings of the dining-room, the western
range of buildings in the lower court, and the west end of the north range.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
The fifth period, from about 1530 to 1624, seems to comprise alterations in
the upper court-yard, the long gallery, and terrace and gardens; the pulpit,
desk, and pews in the chapel; and the barn and bowling-green. The juxtaposition
of the kitchen and great hall show that they belong to the same
period. The alterations since that period appear mainly to have been necessary
repairs.</p>

<p>The principal apartments of Haddon Hall are the Chapel, the Great, or
Banqueting-Hall, with the Minstrels’ Gallery occupying two sides of it; the
Dining-room; the Drawing-room; the earl’s Bed-room and adjoining suite of
rooms; the Ball-room, or Long Gallery; the Ante-room, from which Dorothy
Vernon’s door opens on to the terrace; the State Bed-room; the Ancient
State Room, or Page’s Room; the Kitchens; and the Eagle, or Peverel, or
King John’s Tower. The entrance in this latter was the principal entrance
to the Hall, and communicated with Rowsley and Bakewell by an old road
which still exists. It was the only entrance by which horsemen or carriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
could enter the Hall. The gateway by which visitors now enter, being
intended only for foot-approach, mounted guests had to leave their horses at
the gate. Passing in by this gateway, the visitor enters the first, or lower
court-yard, and sees around him the chief features of this once gay, but now
deserted mansion, grand in its solitude and attractive in its loneliness.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Chapel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The first room usually shown to visitors is the so-called <span class="smcap">Chaplain’s Room</span>,
the first door on the right, after mounting the steps into the lower court. In
this small room, and in the closet attached to it, several objects of interest are
preserved. Among these are a pair of remarkably fine fire-dogs, a warder’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
horn, gigantic jack-Boots, a thick leathern doublet, some matchlocks and some
pewter dishes. In this room, a few years ago, a remarkably curious and
interesting washing-tally, engraved and described in the “Reliquary,” was
found behind the wainscoting. The articles enumerated on this curious
relic are “ruffes,” “bandes,” “cuffes,” “handkercher,” “capps,” “shirtes,”
“halfshirts,” “boote hose,” “topps,” “sockes,” “sheetes,” “pillowberes,”
“tableclothes,” “napkins,” and “towells.” It is in the possession of the
Duke of Rutland.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chapel</span>, which, after the so-called Chaplain’s Room, is the first part
of the interior of Haddon Hall shown to visitors, is, as will be seen by reference
to the ground-plan, at the south-east corner of the building. It consists, at
present, of a nave with side aisle and a chancel, and is entered from the
court-yard by an arched doorway opening into a small ante-chapel, or vestibule,
through which the visitor passes. At the entrance is a <i>stoup</i>, or holy-water
basin, and from the ante-chapel a staircase leads up to the turret. The
arches and pillars of the nave are Norman; but the arches have been cut from
their original semicircular to their present arched form, and the pillars cut
and “shaved down,” and their capitals altered in character. Sufficient of
these capitals, however, remains to show what was their original design. At
the west end of the nave is a remarkably fine and large vestment chest of very
thick timber, having carved on its front two shields of arms. At the opposite
(east) end of the nave is a carved corbel, and, on the floor, is the fine old
altar-table of stone bearing the usual five incised <i>crosses pattée</i>, emblematical
of the five wounds of our blessed Saviour.</p>

<p>Against one of the pillars is a massive circular Norman font, on which is a
curiously constructed cover. This font is engraved on the next page, but
unfortunately the artist has omitted the cover. The chancel is raised a little
above the nave; and on each side is a large high pew, with open railings in
their upper portions, which have been used for the noble families who have
inhabited the place; and the carved panels, and the traces of gilding and
colour they contain, show, along with the remains of paintings on the walls,
how magnificent must have been this place of worship in its palmy days.</p>

<p>The chapel consists of a nave with two aisles of unequal width, and a
chancel. The entire length of the chapel is 49 feet, the chancel being 28 feet
long, and the nave 21 feet. Each aisle has an arcade of two pointed arches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Norman Font in the Chapel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The entrance to the chapel is on the north side, near to the west end. The
different parts of the chapel appear to be of about the following dates, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>The south aisle, and centre circular column of its arcade, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1160. The five
windows of this aisle are each of a single light and pointed. The capital of
the circular column of the arcade has been cut so as to fit the arches subsequently
erected over it. The lower west window, and the north aisle
(except the doorway), and the north arcade, are about <i>A.D.</i> 1310. A window
of this aisle formerly existed to the east of the doorway, but was blocked up
when a staircase was made in the vestibule of the chapel, to give access to a
small room. The chancel, the clerestory of the nave, and the south arcade,
except the circular column, are of about 1425, at which time the glass of the
east window was put in by Richard Vernon, as recorded in an inscription on
the window itself. The bell-turret is supposed to have been erected by
William, son of Richard Vernon, about 1455. The letter W, supposed to be
his initial, is carved on the outside of its wall, towards the court-yard. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
blocking up of the window of the north aisle, and the construction of the
entrance doorway, may be of the same date. William Vernon married
Margaret de Pype; and the Pype arms are on one of the south windows of
the chancel.</p>

<p>The partial removal of the whitewash of the chapel walls, in 1858, led to
several discoveries of the former arrangements of the building, and of the
coloured decorations of the walls; and, were it desirable, a complete restoration
of the interior to its former state would not be difficult.</p>

<p>There were two altars in the chapel&mdash;one at the east end, as usual, and one
under the east window of the south aisle. This latter was, no doubt, a
chantry. The stone slabs which formed the tops of the altars still exist, and
are raised, to the extent of their thickness, above the floor: the east altar-stone
is 8 feet by 3 feet, and is 8 inches thick, the edge being a fillet of 3 inches,
and a chamfer; the surface is so decayed that only one of its original five
<i>crosses pattée</i> now remains.</p>

<p>The altar-stone of the south aisle is 5 feet 6 inches by 2 feet 6 inches, the
edge showing a fillet and chamfer. The five <i>crosses pattée</i> on it are still perfect.
The piscina in the chancel still remains, recessed in a fenestella.</p>

<p>The sill of the south window, near the altar, is low, so as to form a sedilia
bench. In the middle of the sloping sill of the east window a step has been
cut, no doubt for the crucifix to stand on; and on each side of it is a similar
step, probably for candlesticks. On the east wall, on each side of the window,
is a stone bracket, probably to support an image.</p>

<p>On the east wall of the south aisle there is a bracket with a grotesque head,
which was probably intended to support a figure. There are signs of a large
bracket having existed on the north side of the altar; and the base-mould of a
small column, which possibly supported its front edge, may be seen on a block
of stone rising above the pavement.</p>

<p>A very remarkable squint was discovered and reopened in 1859 in the
south-west angle of the chancel, through which a view of the priest officiating
at the chantry altar could be obtained from the rood-loft above.</p>

<p>In the wall, opposite to this squint, is a doorway, which gave passage from
the bell-turret to the rood-loft. The sill of this doorway is 13 feet 9 inches
above the chapel floor. The bell itself is now (1871) in use at the new church
at Rowsley. It had been taken down from the turret many years ago.</p>

<p>Two fragments of the open-work of the rood-screen may be seen in the
west ends of the chancel pews. They are carved in oak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>The font, which is round and perfectly plain, is of the Norman period, and
probably of the same date as the early part of the chapel. It is not in its
original position. The stoup for holy water is near the entrance door of the
chapel.</p>

<p>The windows are not architecturally remarkable, but the glass is deserving
of careful attention. It gives an excellent example of very good effect produced
by very simple means, and excluding very little light from the interior.
Each principal light in the east window, and each light in the head, has a
single figure. The drawing, both in expression and in the grace of the
drapery, is often very good. Yellow stain is extensively employed, but otherwise
colour is sparingly, though very effectively used. There are no canopies,
or other architectural accessories. The quarries, forming the groundwork of
the windows, come close up to the figures. There are eight patterns of
quarries remaining, besides six birds, each of a different form. Most of these
patterns are good, and the whole of them may be found in the east window,
except one which is in the south-west window of the chancel.</p>

<p>The east window has five lights. Much of the glass has been destroyed;
what remains was re-leaded in 1858, and arranged according to the original
design. No new coloured glass was introduced, but some old quarries were
collected from other windows of the chapel, and placed in the east window to
complete the groundwork. In the centre light the figure of our Saviour on
the cross is nearly perfect. In the next light, on either side, is a figure more
or less mutilated, and each has lost the head. One of them represents the
Virgin; the other appears to be St. John, though, apparently through some
mistake of the artist, he has the emblems of St. John the Baptist. The figures
of the two outer lights are entirely gone. The emblems of two of the evangelists
remain. In the lights of the head are figures of saints, generally well
drawn. Below the principal figures of this window are three shields of arms,
supported by angels, gracefully drawn. These arms are, <i>argent</i>, a lion rampant
<i>gules</i>, ducally crowned, <i>or</i>; <i>argent</i>, fretty, <i>sable</i>, a canton of the first; and
another shield, the bearing on which has been lost. At the bottom of the
window are the remains of an inscription to Sir Richard Vernon and Benedict
Ludlow his wife, as follows:&mdash;<i>Orate pro āiābus Ricardi Vernon et Benedicite
uxoris eius qui fecerunt anō d̄ni milesimo</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">CCCCXXVII</span>. This Sir Richard Vernon,
who was born in 1391, and succeeded his father in 1401, married Benedict,
daughter of Sir John Ludlow of Hodnet, and died in 1451. He was
“Treasurer of Calais, Captain of Rouen, and Speaker of the Parliament of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Leicester, in the fourth year of Henry VI. in 1426.” Above the crucifix are
the royal arms, quarterly, first and fourth France, second and third England.
In the outer lights are a knight kneeling at a table, and fragments of an
ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>The flat-headed windows on each side of the altar, in the north and south
sides of the chancel, have each three principal lights, and six lights in the heads,
each containing the figure of an apostle, effectively drawn.</p>

<p>The centre light of the north window has a figure of the Virgin being
taught to read by St. Anne. To the right of this, as we face the window, is
the figure of St. George slaying the dragon, and in the other light is the figure
of St. Michael trampling on a six-headed dragon. Beneath, there are three
mutilated shields of arms of Vernon, &amp;c., and in the bottom of the window are
the remains of a candlestick or hour-glass stand. In the south window are
the arms of Pype, <i>azure</i>, crucilly of cross-crosslets and two pipes in pale, <i>or</i>;
and those of Vernon, <i>argent</i>, fretty, <i>sable</i>, on the dexter side of an impaled
shield, the impalement on which is lost. Over the arms of Pype is the
fragment of the original inscription, reading “Margareta Pype, vxo.”</p>

<p>The mural decorations, of which traces have been found, are of various
character and of much interest. The oldest fragments are two running
patterns of good design. One is on the arches of the north arcade, and of the
same date as the stonework on which it appears, viz., about 1310. The other,
which seems to be of the same age, is on one of the jambs of the east window
of the south aisle, over the altar. In this window there are traces of a figure,
now almost entirely destroyed. Over the arches of the nave there are traces
of two different designs, one on each wall. Both are much defaced. On the
west wall of the nave there is a design consisting of a running pattern of
rose branches and leaves, with red flowers of five petals. The stems and
leaves are shaded grey and black. Traces of the same design have been found
on the walls of the south aisle, and on the jambs of its west window. The
date of this rose pattern is probably about 1427, when the glass of the east
window of the chancel was put in.</p>

<p>There is a pattern of green and dull red on the east wall of the chancel,
and on the south wall is a very similar pattern, which enclosed four groups of
figures, two on each side of the window over the sedilia bench. There is no
border surrounding each group, but merely the diaper pattern. They are
probably of the same date as the glass in the east window. The figures of
these groups are generally effectively drawn, though with occasional exaggeration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and distortion. They are in distemper on the plaster, and are black, with
the exception of some dresses, which are green. There are scrolls to each
group, corresponding with the number of figures, but without any name.
These groups had been much injured before they were covered with whitewash,
and the injury appears as if partially intentional. The groups form a series of
subjects, and commence with the upper group on the east side of the window.
The subject is the presentation of the Virgin in the Temple by Joachim and
Anna. The three figures remain. Below this is a group, much injured,
apparently Anna teaching the Virgin to read, whilst Joachim stands by. Two
of these groups, for which we are indebted to the “Reliquary,” are here shown.</p>

         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>Wall-paintings in the Chapel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The upper group on the west is a Holy Family. The Virgin holds the
infant Jesus in her arms; St. Joseph stands by; St. John the Baptist raises
his hands and eyes towards the infant Saviour.</p>

<p>Below this is a group, much injured, with four scrolls, and apparently four
figures. A female figure, probably the Virgin, seems to be carrying a child,
whilst a male figure follows behind. There seem to be indications of a fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and small figure. The subject appears to be the flight into Egypt, with,
contrary to custom, the figure of St. John introduced.</p>

<p>Traces of colour are found on the fenestella of the piscina, on the circular
columns of the south arcade, and on the brackets near the altar.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Steps to State Apartments.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Leaving the chapel, the visitor will cross the court-yard to the <span class="smcap">Banqueting-Hall</span>;
but he will notice on his way a flight of stone steps leading from
the court-yard, near the doorway of the ante-chapel, up to the state apartments,
so that the family could attend the chapel without passing through the
hall, and could also, with their guests, be admitted at other times to their suite
of rooms.</p>

<p>In this first court-yard he will also do well to take especial notice of the
beautiful and intricate designs on the lead-work of the heads of the spouts&mdash;many
of which are filled with delicate Gothic tracery&mdash;and the gargoyles, or
water-spouts, some of which are grotesquely carved in figures of curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
character, and some of them of uncouth shape. One or two of these we have
engraved on another page.</p>

<p>Entering the open doorway of the advanced porch, which, with a wide
passage adjoining, forms the way through to the inner, or second court-yard,
the visitor will notice, standing on the stone bench on his left hand, a fine
Roman altar which, many years ago, was
dug up in the grounds. It bears the
inscription,&mdash;</p>

<p>To the left of the passage four arched
doorways conduct respectively to the
buttery, the great kitchen, and other
domestic offices, and to a staircase leading
to the long suite of chambers on the north side, and also communicating,
by means of a gallery in the Banqueting-Hall, with all the other
apartments of the building. To the right is a massive and time-worn oak
screen, with two open doorways, which divides the Banqueting-Hall from the
passage. Entering by the first of these openings in the screen, the visitor
will not fail to notice a suspicious-looking little iron bracket with ring attached,
high above his head. This, tradition says, was an instrument of punishment
for enforcing the observance of laws of conviviality. For it is said, if, in the
days of feasting and merriment in the “good old times,” a man should fail to
drink up his quota of liquor, he was fastened up by the wrist to this ring, and
the liquor poured down his sleeve so as gradually to trickle down him on to
the floor; or, if guilty of any other breach of the law or decorum of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
board, he was similarly tied up, and compelled so to remain during the
carousal, and was treated now and then not only with a stream of cold water
poured down his sleeve, but by other indignities forced upon him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Banqueting-Hall</span>, or <span class="smcap">Great Hall</span>, as it is sometimes called, measures,
within the screen, about 35 feet in length, and about 25 in width, and it is of
the full height of the building, with an open timber roof. It is entered, as has
just been stated, by two open doorways in the screen which separates it from
the passage. The screen also forms the front of the <span class="smcap">Minstrels’ Gallery</span> over
the passage. The screen is beautifully panelled, each panel being headed with
cinquefoil cusps, above which is other Gothic tracery of elegant design. At
the opposite end from this screen is the raised daïs for the lord and his family
and honoured guests, where still stands the grand old table on which so many
of the good things of this life have been spread in ages long since passed away.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Old Oak Table in the Banqueting Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This table is one of the finest examples of its kind yet remaining anywhere in
existence&mdash;it is now worm-eaten and decayed, like those who once feasted
around it; but still it stands, a proud monument of those ancient times so
long gone by. Over the daïs a modern window has been inserted, and formerly
a doorway, to the left of the lord as he sat in the centre of the large table,
opened into what is now the dining-room, but in those days was the withdrawing-room.</p>

<p>To the right hand, on entering, is the gigantic fire-place with
its huge open chimney; and on the opposite side, at the end next the high
table, a flight of steps leads up to the state apartments; and close by, through
a corner partitioned off by the oak wainscoting, another door leads to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
private dining-room and to the grounds. On the walls of the Banqueting-Hall
are some magnificent stags’ heads and antlers, which bear evidence not
only of extremely fine growth, but of great age, since they fell to the lord of
the chase. There are also several pieces of old furniture: and on the walls
are oil-paintings of Martin Middleton of Hazelbadge, and of an old and favourite
huntsman and gamekeeper&mdash;honoured and respected retainers of the family.</p>

<p>The galleried passage, of a later date, to the Minstrels’ Gallery, occupies
one side, and the “Minstrels’ Gallery” itself one end, of the Banqueting-Hall&mdash;that
portion of the gallery along the side forming a passage from the drawing-room
and state apartments on one side to the range of rooms on the other.
The portion of the gallery over the end of the hall is considerably wider than
the other, and would hold a goodly company of minstrels, or of guests, to look
down on the “lord of misrule” and other revels below. In one of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
engravings we show the panelled front of the Minstrels’ Gallery, and on the
preceding page we give a vignette of the entrance to the gallery from the
drawing room.</p>

<p>Passing out from the Banqueting-Hall, the visitor should next enter the
<span class="smcap">Dining-room</span>, which is one of the most charming, and certainly one of the
most interesting, apartments in the whole building. The end opposite to the
entrance doorway is entirely taken up by a Gothic window of eight lights,
filled with glass disposed in an elaborate geometric pattern. In some of the
lights are shields of arms in stained glass, one of which displays the arms of
Vernon with its quarterings of Avenell, Pype, &amp;c., &amp;c.; another, Vernon only;
and another, Vernon impaled. This room is wainscoted, the upper row of
panels throughout being filled in with exquisitely-carved Gothic tracery and
with heraldic bearings, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Over the centre of the fire-place are the royal arms of England (quarterly
France and England) with the supporters, a greyhound and a griffin, and on
the one side a shield bearing the three feathers of the Prince of Wales, with the
initials E. P., and on the other the arms of Vernon with its quarterings, and
supported by a lion and a boar. Below these is the motto, “<span class="smcap lowercase">DREDE GOD AND
HONOR THE KYNG</span>,” carved in Gothic capitals. Near this also is the carved
inscription, “Anno Dni 1545. Monseigneir de Vernon,” and, with arms, the
initials “G. V.,” and “M. V.” The remainder of this fine old heraldic frieze
contains a large number of shields bearing the arms of the Vernons and of the
various families allied with them, interspersed with the Vernon crest, &amp;c. At
the end of the room next the fire-place is a small, but exquisitely beautiful,
recessed or oriel window, with seats on all sides, and forming one of the most
delicious little retirements imaginable&mdash;overlooking, as it does, the lawns and
terraces, and the romantic grounds and winding river, of Haddon. This recess
is panelled in the same elaborate heraldic and Gothic manner as the room
itself, and, besides the coats of arms and crests, bears on one of its panels a
grotesque head of a court fool, or jester, traditionally said to have been
intended as a portrait of Will Somers, jester to the “merry monarch” and
to his predecessor; and on two others the heads of Henry VII. and his Queen,
Elizabeth of York.</p>

<p>The ceiling of the dining-room is divided into compartments by transverse
beams, and has been elaborately painted and decorated. In the large window
will be noticed a fine old wine-cooler of bronze, and the fire-place and fire-dogs
are also very curious and interesting.</p>

stairs leading up from the Banqueting-Hall to the state apartments. Arriving
at the top of this short staircase he will find three doorways, that to the
left opening into the long gallery, or ball-room; the one to the right giving
access to the drawing-room, the Earl’s room, &amp;c.; and the third simply
opening to a staircase to the leads, &amp;c. Passing through the door to the right
the visitor enters the <span class="smcap">Drawing-room</span>, which is situated over the Dining-room
just described. It is a charming room, hung with grand old tapestry, above
which is a frieze of ornamented mouldings, in pargetting work. This frieze is
of five heights, each being decorated with a separate moulding of raised
festoons, fruits, flowers, &amp;c.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Ante-room to the Earl’s Bed room.</i></p>
</div>

<p>To the left, on entering, is a beautiful recessed,
or bay, window, over the similar one in the Dining-room; and from this
window one of the most beautiful views of the terrace, the foot-bridge, the
river, and the grounds, is obtained. This window recess is wainscoted in
panels, which have originally been painted and gilt&mdash;portions of the colour
and gilding still remaining; its ceiling is in the form of a large star of eight
points, with intersecting segments of circles attaching the inner angles to each
other, and forming a geometric pattern of great beauty. The ceiling of the
room is also richly ornamented. Above and around the fire-place the wall is
wainscoted in panels, in a similar manner to the recess. In the fire-place is
one of the most curious of existing grates, the alternate upright bars of which
terminate in <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, and a pair of exquisitely beautiful fire-dogs; the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
bosses on each being of open metal-work, of the most chaste and elaborate
design and workmanship. They are of brass; and the bosses, which are
circular, are designed in foliage and flowers.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Ball-room, or Long Gallery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In these beautiful remains Haddon is especially rich; but the pair in this
room, and the two remarkably fine enamelled bosses in the so-called “Chaplain’s
Room,” are the most interesting and elegant. Opposite to the recessed
window, a doorway in the tapestry opens upon the side gallery of the “Banqueting
Hall,” and so gives access to, and communication with, the apartments
on the opposite side of the quadrangle.</p>

<p>The opposite end of the Drawing-room from the entrance doorway is occupied
by a large window, of similar size to that in the Dining-room beneath it,
which overlooks the lower court-yard or quadrangle. In this room are still
preserved some pieces of ancient furniture. Near the further window a doorway
opens into what is called</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Earl’s Dressing-room</span>, a small but remarkably pretty apartment,
hung with tapestry, and lighted by a recessed window. This room, as shown
in our engraving, immediately communicates with</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Earl’s Bed-chamber</span>, so called in connection with the one just
described, because thus occupied by the Earls of Rutland when residing at
Haddon. This room is hung with tapestry representing hunting scenes, &amp;c.
From this chamber a doorway opens into</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lady’s Dressing-room</span>, also hung with tapestry, and lighted with a
recessed window. From this room a doorway opens out to the top of the
flight of steps already spoken of as giving access to these apartments from the
lower court-yard. By this means access was easily obtained to the chapel,
and the lord and lady could enter or leave these apartments without passing
through the Banqueting Hall. A small padlocked door, in the tapestry of
this room, leads up a narrow flight of steps to the leads over the chapel and
to the open side of the belfry tower, where the works of the old clock may
be seen.</p>

<p>Returning through the Earl’s Bed-chamber and Dressing-room, from the
fire-grate in which it is said “the celebrated Count Rumford obtained his
plan to prevent chimneys smoking,” and retracing his steps through the
Drawing-room, the visitor passes out to the landing-place of the staircase
leading up from the Banqueting Hall. From this a doorway leads up to a
small rude apartment, with a fire-place, and an old chest; and also
leads to the leads of the roof of the Drawing-room, Earl’s Bed-room, Long
Gallery, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Long Gallery</span>, or <span class="smcap">Ball-room</span>, one of the glories of fine old Haddon,
is next entered by a flight of semicircular steps of solid oak, said to have been
cut from the root of a single tree that grew in the park of Haddon, the trunk
and arms of which are also asserted to have furnished the whole of the timber
of the floor of the Long Gallery, or Ball-room, itself. Thus, if the story be
true, the whole of the flooring of this superb apartment, which is 109½ feet
in length, and 18 feet in width, as well as these massive steps outside the
room, were obtained from one single oak-tree grown on the spot.</p>

<p>Ascending the <span class="smcap">Steps</span>, of which we give an engraving, the visitor will do
well to notice the lock and other details of the door, which are somewhat
curious. This noble apartment extends, as will be seen on reference to the
engraved plan already given, nearly the entire length of the south side of the
upper court-yard&mdash;commencing near the Banqueting Hall, and, running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the entire remaining length of the upper court-yard, is carried out into the
winter garden beyond.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Steps to the Ball-room.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This grand room is wainscoted throughout its entire dimensions with oak
panelling of remarkably good architectural character. The general design is a
series of semicircular arches, alternately large and small, divided by pilasters
with foliated capitals, and surmounted by a frieze and a turreted and battlemented
cornice. The pilasters, divided like the whole design up to the frieze,
are of three heights. The basement of the wainscoting, about one-eighth
of its entire height, is plainly
panelled, and devoid of all ornament.
The second height, rising to
more than a third of the whole, is
of a much more decorated character.
The pilasters are fluted, and the
spaces between them filled in with
geometric designs, the narrower
spaces being by far the most elaborate
in their design. The third
height is a series of semicircular
arches, alternately wide and narrow,
divided by the pilasters, the crown
of the arch of the narrower ones
being on a level with the springing
of the larger ones. The whole of
the arches, in which pictures formerly
hung, spring from small
brackets and semi-pilasters at the
sides of the pilasters, and are elaborately
decorated. Over each of the
smaller arches is a shield of the arms
of Manners, with a crescent for difference, and surmounted on the frieze by
their crest, a peacock displayed, also differenced with a crescent, alternating
with those of the Vernon crest, a boar’s head. The pilasters in this height
are carved in scale pattern, and are finished with capitals of foliage filling up
the spandrels of the arches. Above these is the frieze, the spaces of which
are occupied respectively with the crests just named, alternating with the rose
and thistle conjoined on one stem. Above this is a remarkably fine turreted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and battlemented cornice, in which the loopholes, &amp;c., are cut quite through
the whole thickness of the wood.</p>

<p>The ceiling of this magnificent room is coved&mdash;the coving receding for the
cornice. It is covered with elaborate and exquisitely designed geometric
tracery, consisting of squares, lozenges, quatrefoils, &amp;c., beautifully foliated
at their points, and containing shields of arms and crests, the arms being
those of Manners impaling Vernon, and the crests those of Manners and
Vernon alternately. This ceiling was originally painted and gilt in a very
rich manner, remains of the colouring
and gilding being still distinguishable,
here and there, through the
whitewash. On the walls still hang
one or two pictures, which perhaps,
however, only add to the solitariness
of its appearance.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Dorothy Vernon’s Door: Interior.</i></p>
</div>

<p>On the south side of this noble
apartment is a charming central recessed
window of large size, 15 feet
by 12 feet&mdash;large enough, in fact, to
accommodate a goodly party around
the fine old central table, which still
remains&mdash;and two smaller recessed,
or bay, windows. On the north side
are two windows looking into the
upper court-yard; the east end is
entirely taken up by a strongly
stone-mullioned window of twenty-four
lights, with a side window on
each side. In the recessed windows
are the royal arms of England, and
the arms of Vernon, Manners, Talbot, &amp;c., in stained glass. Our engraving
shows about one-half, in length, of this noble room.</p>

<p>Opposite to the central recess is a fire-place, which still holds the original
fire-dogs rising from goats’ feet, and decorated with human heads and heads of
goats. In the centre of the large window at the end will be observed a glass
case, containing a cast of the head of Lady Grace Manners, whose monument
is in Bakewell Church. She was the daughter of Sir Henry Pierrepoint, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
wife of Sir George Manners, of Haddon, the eldest son and heir of Sir John
Manners and Dorothy Vernon his wife. Lady Grace “bore to him (her
husband) four sons and five daughters, and lived with him in holy wedlock
thirty years. She caused him to be buried with his forefathers, and then
placed this monument (at Bakewell) at her own expense, as a perpetual
memorial of their conjugal faith, and she joined the figure of his body with
hers, having vowed their ashes and bones should be laid together.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Dorothy Vernon’s Door: Exterior.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From near the upper end of this Long Gallery, or Ball-room, a highly
enriched doorway opens into the Ante-room, or Lord’s Parlour.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ante-room</span>, now occasionally called the “Lord’s Parlour,” and, two
centuries ago, was designated the “Orange Parlour,” is a small room, hung
with paintings, and having around the upper part of its walls a cornice
embellished with the crests of the Vernon and Manners families. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
interest, however, attached to this apartment rests in the strongly barred door
which opens from it on to a flight of stone steps leading down to the terrace
and winter-garden. This doorway, known far and wide as <span class="smcap">Dorothy Vernon’s
Door</span>, we have engraved, both as seen from its exterior side and its interior
side, and have also given the “initial” illustration on page 221.</p>

<p>It is said, and no doubt with truth, that it was through this doorway and
down these steps that the lovely Dorothy Vernon, one of the co-heiresses of
that grand old family, passed on the night of her elopement, and that at the
top of the opposite flight of steps, shown in our ground plan, and known as
“Dorothy Vernon’s Steps,” she was received into the arms of her ardent and
true lover, John Manners, who had horses in waiting; and that they flew
through the woods and fields until they gained the high road, and made their
way into the neighbouring county. It was through this doorway then that
not only the lovely Dorothy passed, but with her the fine old mansion itself
and all its broad lands, into the hands of the noble family now owning it.</p>

<p>Very sweetly has the tradition of the love and elopement of this noble
pair been worked up by imagination in a story, “The Love-steps of Dorothy
Vernon,” by a popular writer in the “Reliquary;” and thus another modern
author very pleasantly embodies it in verse:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The green old turrets, all ivy-thatch,</p>
<p class="pp7">Above the cedars that girdle them, rise,</p>
<p class="pp6">The pleasant glow of the sunshine catch,</p>
<p class="pp7">And outline sharp on the bluest of skies.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“All is silent within and around;</p>
<p class="pp7">The ghostly house and the ghostly trees</p>
<p class="pp6">Sleep in the heat, with never a sound</p>
<p class="pp7">Of human voices or freshening breeze.</p>

<p class="pp8 ls2">*****</p>

<p class="pp6q">“It is a night with never a star,</p>
<p class="pp7">And the Hall with revelry throbs and gleams;</p>
<p class="pp6">There grates a hinge&mdash;the door is ajar&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp7">And a shaft of light in the darkness streams.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“A faint sweet face, a glimmering gem,</p>
<p class="pp7">And then two figures steal into light;</p>
<p class="pp6">A flash, and darkness has swallowed them&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp7">So sudden is Dorothy Vernon’s flight!”</p>

<p class="p1">Passing through the Ante-room, the visitor next enters the <span class="smcap">State Bed-room</span>,
known two hundred years ago, it seems, as the “Blue Drawing-room.”
The walls are hung with Gobelins tapestry, the subjects being illustrations of
Æsop’s Fables; and above this is a frieze, similar to that in the Ante-room,
bearing the crests of Vernon and Manners. This apartment is lighted by a
large bay-window, overlooking the upper court-yard, and raised a couple of steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
above the level of the floor of the room itself. In this window stands an antique
dressing-table and a grand old looking-glass, which are worthy of the most
careful examination. Over the chimney-piece is a fine example of pargetting,
representing Orpheus, by his musical powers, charming the brute creation.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The State Bed-room.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">State Bed</span>, shown in our engraving, measures 14 feet 6 inches in
height. It is furnished in green silk velvet and white satin, exquisitely
embroidered and enriched with needlework. It is one of the finest remaining
beds in existence, and is presumed to be the work of Eleanor, daughter of
Thomas, and eldest sister and co-heiress of Edmund, Lord Roos, of Hamlake,
and wife of Sir Robert Manners; which lady died in 1487. According to
traditional report, it was removed many years ago from Haddon to Belvoir
Castle, and afterwards restored to Haddon. The last person who ever slept
in it is said to have been George IV., when Prince Regent; he occupied it
during his visit to Belvoir Castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>From the State Bed-room a doorway behind the tapestry opens upon a
short flight of stone steps, leading to what is usually called the <span class="smcap">Ancient State
Room</span>, or <span class="smcap">Page’s Room</span>, and which two centuries ago was called the “Best
Lodging-room.”</p>

<p>This apartment, like the previous one, is hung with Gobelins tapestry, the
subjects being illustrations of some of the events in the life of Moses. The
thickness of the walls, the small size of the windows, and the lowness of these
rooms, show that they belong to the more ancient part of the building.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Archers’ Room&mdash;for Stringing Bows, &amp;c.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From the Page’s Room a short flight of steps leads into a passage, or small
room, which may appropriately be called the <span class="smcap">Archers’ Room</span> and is shown in
our engraving, where the visitor will notice a remarkable <span class="smcap">Wooden Frame</span> for
the stringing of bows and cross-bows&mdash;the only one probably which he will
ever see preserved. It forms one of our illustrations. The passage leads by
a few stone steps into a rude apartment, probably a guard-room, where, behind
the rafters, innumerable bats now build their nests; also into the cross-bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
room, where the bows were hung; and into several other old and cheerless-looking
rooms; also to a spiral stone staircase, which, springing from the
gateway under the <span class="smcap">Peverel Tower</span>, leads by seventy steps, some so worn
that they have been covered by wooden ones, to the top of the tower, the
ascent of which will amply repay the visitor for his trouble by the grand and
interestingly beautiful view he obtains
of the mansion and the neighbourhood.
Of the turret on the
<span class="smcap">Peverel</span>, or <span class="smcap">Eagle Tower</span>, we give
an engraving.</p>

<p>Having descended the tower, the
visitor returns through the State
Bed-room into the Ante-room, and
is here usually dismissed into the
grounds, through “Dorothy Vernon’s
Door.” As we have not, however,
initiated <i>our</i> tourist into the
mysteries of all the rooms and passages
of this noble pile of building,
we will not dismiss <i>him</i> in this summary
manner, but bring him back
into the Banqueting Hall, whence
we will show him the kitchens and
suite of rooms on the north side,
and then conduct him to the
grounds and to some of the interesting
places in the neighbourhood.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Rack for Stringing the Bows.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Kitchen</span> and range of domestic
offices at Haddon are very large and
extensive, and show, more strikingly than any description, the marvellous
amount of cooking that must have been carried on, and the more than princely
hospitality observed by its owners in its palmy days.</p>

<p>The four doorways, already spoken of as existing in the wall of the passage
opposite to the screen of the Banqueting-Hall, and beneath the Minstrels’
Gallery, have all of them pointed arches. The first of these doorways, on
entering from the lower court-yard, or quadrangle, yet retains its old oaken
door. This room was the <i>buttery</i>, and the door still has perfect its buttery-hatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
in the middle. This is a small opening, with a little wicket to close and
fit, just large enough to pass out a trencher of provisions to the servants or
retainers, or as alms to wayfarers. From this room a flight of stone steps
conducts to the vaulted cellars, and it also communicates with the storerooms
and other offices, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

     <p class="pc"><i>The Eagle, or Peverel Tower.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The second doorway, which is open, leads down a long passage to the
<span class="smcap">Great Kitchen</span>. At the end, the
passage terminates in a strong and
massive half-door, the top of which
is formed into a broad shelf. To
this point only were the servants
permitted to come, but were forbidden
access to the kitchen itself.
The dishes were placed on the door-shelf
by the cooks on the one side,
and removed by the servitors on the
other, and by them carried up the
passage into the Banqueting-Hall.
The kitchen is of immense size, its
ceiling supported by massive beams
and by a central support of solid
oak. It contains two enormous fire-places,
stoves for various purposes,
and spits, pot-hooks, and tenter-hooks
by the score; enormous chopping-blocks,
dressers of all sorts and
sizes, tables of solid oak, six or seven
inches in thickness, and hollowed
into circular chopping-troughs&mdash;one
of which is worn through by constant
use&mdash;and every possible appliance for keeping open house in the most lavish
style. Adjoining the kitchen are a number of rooms, bakehouse, larders,
pantries, salting-rooms, &amp;c., all fitted in the same marvellously massive
manner. In one of these should be noticed an enormous salting-trough,
hollowed out of one immense block of wood, without joint or fastening. This
is among the most wonderful relics of the place, and ought to claim attention
from the visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The third doorway opens into what is conjectured to have been the wine-cellar&mdash;a
vaulted room well adapted for the purpose, and close at hand for
the Banqueting Hall.</p>

<p>The fourth doorway opens at the foot of a flight of stairs leading up to the
apartments on the north side, which, for more than half its length, contains a
second as well as a first floor. These rooms are many in number, and
curiously labyrinthine in construction, and although not possessing attraction
enough to be shown to the general
visitor, are nevertheless among the
most interesting in the mansion.
Some of them are hung with tapestry
which ranks among the best in the
house: one room especially, where
groups of children gathering fruit are
depicted, is peculiarly beautiful. In
two of the apartments on this side
are charming little closets, on the
tapestry of one of which the royal
arms are depicted.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Gallery across Small Yard.</i></p>
</div>

<p>One of these tapestried rooms is
named in an old list of apartments of
1666 as “Lady Dorothy’s Chamber,”
and a neighbouring apartment is
called “Lady Cranborne’s Chamber.”
A third tapestried apartment was
called “Roger Manners’ Room.”
All these rooms are on the central
portion of the northern side of the
Hall, over the kitchen and adjoining
rooms.  The apartment over the
buttery was the “Great Nursery.”</p>

<p>Most of the rooms on this side of the building have evidently been intended
for sleeping apartments; and there is a staircase with ornamental rails, on
which remains of the original gilding still serve as a relief to the sombre colour
of the oak.</p>

<p>One of the most charming “bits” on this side is a short <span class="smcap">Wooden Gallery</span>,
here engraved, with oak balustrades, which leads across a tiny little open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
court from one of the tapestried apartments to another, and on the walls of
which mosses and lichens grow in luxuriance. It is just the spot, opening
from the heated rooms, for a lounge in the pure air; and no doubt from this
gallery Dorothy Vernon, and many another high-bred dame, has looked up
to the stars overhead while passing from room to room, on a festive night, as
well as on many a quiet evening.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Room over the Entrance Gateway.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Among the apartments not usually shown are also two handsome wainscoted
rooms, with carved ceilings, situated over each other, in the entrance gateway
tower. Above the uppermost of these is a room supposed to have been a
place of confinement, because there are traces of <i>external</i> bolts and bars.
It has two windows, in one of which are two massive stone seats inserted
in the wall. It has also a door leading out to the leads.</p>

<p>Most of the points of interest have now been described; but the curious
rambler, who may choose to linger and pry into nooks and corners, will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
well to visit some of the basement rooms&mdash;as that on the left-hand side under
the Eagle or Peverel Tower&mdash;an arched warder’s room, where he will note
the thickness of the walls (7 feet); the next room westward, which seems to
have been the earlier kitchen and bakehouse; the room under the State Bed-room,
used in later times as a gymnasium for the family; the Armoury, which
is under that portion of the Long Gallery with the deep projecting recess; and
the rooms under the Long Gallery nearer the Dining-room, where the splay
of the windows is nearly 9 feet, and which seem to have been used as washing-houses.
Also the so-called Aviary, which opens toward the garden, under
the Earl’s Bed-room and adjoining rooms; and of the rooms yet unmentioned
on the west side of the lower courts, suffice it to say, that on the ground
floor, next to the so-called Chaplain’s Room, were two waiting-rooms; and
then the Steward’s Room, next to the chapel entrance; over this entrance the
Steward’s Bed-room, approached by a spiral staircase near the belfry tower
from a closet in which access is gained to the leads; and after passing the
clerestory windows of the chapel, there is an angle commanding a good view
of the lower court. Then on this first floor are a bed-room, the “Barmaster’s
Room;” the real Chaplain’s Room, in which is now a collection of
bones; a small room still used by the duke for private papers; and another
bed-room, which brings us back to the entrance gateway.</p>

<p>But enough has been said of the interior of Haddon to satisfy the wants
of the tourist, and, although we could linger for hours over the various rooms
not yet specifically described, and fill several chapters with their description,
we must reluctantly leave them, and pass on into the grounds, and so make
our way to Bakewell, to show the visitor the last resting-places of the noble
families to whom Haddon has belonged.</p>

<p>Leaving, then, by a small doorway at the end of a passage leading out
from the Banqueting-Hall, and passing the Dining-room on the right, the
visitor will enter what is called the “Upper Garden.” To his right he will
see below him, on looking over the strongly-buttressed wall&mdash;one of the oldest
parts of the building&mdash;the “Lower Garden,” roughly terraced down the hill
side, and to his right a gravelled path leads by the side of the building to the wall
of the chapel, where, by a long flight of sixty-seven steps, it descends to the old
foot-bridge&mdash;one of the prettiest objects in the grounds: this we have engraved.</p>

<p>To his left, the “Upper Garden,” 120 feet square, is a lawn; up its centre,
as well as around it, runs a broad gravel walk, opposite to which rises a
splendid wide flight of stone steps, with stone balustrades, leading to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Terrace</span> and <span class="smcap">Winter Garden</span>. Along the sides of this garden are beds
partitioned off by hedges, or as they may more appropriately be called, walls
of yew and box.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Terrace.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Terrace</span>, one of the glories of Haddon, extends the full width of the
Upper Garden, the balustraded wall running flush with the end of the Long
Gallery. From this terrace the finest view of the south front of Haddon is
obtained, and it is indeed a view to revel in, and not to be forgotten. The
<span class="smcap">Winter Garden</span> of the terrace is planted with yew-trees, many centuries old,
whose gnarled and knotted roots may be seen curiously intertwining and
displacing the stone edgings of the parterres. It is altogether one of the most
charming outdoor “bits” which even the most romantic and vivid imagination
can conceive.</p>

<p>At the north end of the Winter Garden of Haddon Hall, in that charmingly
shady corner formed by the wall of the Long Gallery on the one side, the
outer wall of the garden on the opposite, and overhung with a grand melancholy-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
yew-tree, which casts a sombre and even gloomy shadow across
it, is that most attractive feature of the mansion, “Dorothy Vernon’s Door,”
previously spoken of as opening out of the Ante-room.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Hall from the Terrace.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From the interior, by the way of Dorothy Vernon’s Door, a short flight
of stone steps, with balustrated sides, leads down to the Winter Garden, on
the opposite side of which, nearly opposite to this doorway, a long flight of
stone steps leads up to another, and considerably higher terrace, called
<span class="smcap">Dorothy Vernon’s Walk</span>&mdash;a broad pathway, or promenade, passing between
an avenue of lofty lime and sycamore trees&mdash;and one of the most secluded
and romantic “lovers’ walks” in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The old <span class="smcap">Bowling Green</span>, near the summit of the hill above Haddon,
occupied an acre of ground, and was approached by an avenue of trees.
It was enclosed by a thick hedge of yew, with a flight of stone steps for
an entrance. On one side was a lodge, or summer-house, over one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
doorways of which are initials and the date of 1696. The “Green” is now
converted into a garden. The old kitchen-garden, years ago taken away, was
situated near the foot-bridge.</p>

<p>There is also a plot of ground, levelled, and in form a parallelogram,
which is known as the “Archery Ground.”</p>

<p>Before leaving Haddon, the visitor should step inside the building now used
as a stable, in which he will find some features worthy of observation. In the
cottage inhabited by the kindly and respected custodian of Haddon, is some
fine carved furniture, and in the garden in front, the yew trees, cut into the
form of a peacock and a boar’s head&mdash;the crests of Manners and of Vernon&mdash;form
pleasing objects, and are sure to attract the attention of the visitor.</p>

</div>
<p class="dc16 p2">MANY other interesting particulars regarding this
grand old mansion might be given, but we now
proceed to speak of the family of its present noble
owner, the Duke of Rutland, in the same way as
we have already done of its former possessors,
the Avenells and Vernons.</p>

<p>The noble family of Manners, like that of
Vernon, is of considerable antiquity; and, although
the records of its early members do not
extend so far back as those of the Vernons, its
history is more illustrious, and its dignities are
more exalted. The most ancient of the ancestors
of the present Duke of Rutland, of whom there
is direct evidence, was Sir Robert Manners, Lord
of the Manor of Ethale, in Northumberland, from whom
descended another Sir Robert, who married Philippa,
daughter of St. Bartholomew de Mont Bouchier, by whom
he had issue, a son, also named Robert, who married Hawise,
daughter of Robert, Baron de Muschamp, in the reign of Henry I.
Their great-grandson, another Sir Robert Manners, married Agnes,
daughter of Sir David Coupland. Their son, Sir Robert, had issue
by his wife, Joan de Heton, four sons; three of whom dying without
issue, the second son, William Manners, inherited the estates. He
married Ellen, or Janetta, daughter of David Baxter, of Derby, by whom
he had a son, Sir Robert Manners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>This Sir Robert was returned in the seventeenth year of Edward III., as
one of the principal persons in the county of Northumberland, and was entitled
to bear arms by descent. In the first year of Edward’s reign, being governor
of Norham Castle, he distinguished himself by his successful defence of that
stronghold against the Scots, who “despising King Edward’s youth, on the
very night of that day on which King Edward was crowned, intended to take
Norham Castle by surprise; and so well managed their design, that about
sixteen of them had already mounted the walls. But the captain, Sir Robert
Manners, being warned of the matter beforehand, by one of his garrison, who
was a Scotsman, had so well prepared to receive them, that of those who had
mounted he took five or six, and put the rest to the sword, their companions
below, upon this disappointment, retiring.” In the next year he was constituted
one of the “conservators of the truce made with the Scots for all
hostilities to cease.” Soon afterwards he was made Sheriff of the county of
Selkirk, and appointed to keep and defend the forts of Selkirk, and Ettrick,
&amp;c. In the fourteenth of the same reign he represented Northumberland in
Parliament, and again subdued Scotch incursions. Soon afterwards he
obtained a licence from the king “to strengthen and embattle his dwelling-house
at Ethale, in Northumberland, with a wall made of stone and lime, and
to hold the same to himself and his heirs for ever.” The next year he was
constituted one of the Commissioners to treat with David Bruce and his
adherents for a peace, and subsequently was made Lord of the Marches.
At the battle of Neville’s Cross, in 1346, under Queen Philippa, in which
the Scottish king was taken prisoner, Sir Robert displayed great valour, and
was entrusted to keep charge of the prisoners, and deliver them to the
Constable at the Tower of London. He died in 1355, leaving his son and
heir, John de Manners (by his wife Aliva, or Alice, daughter of Henry
Strather), only one year and three weeks old.</p>

<p>This John Manners received the honour of knighthood, and married Alice,
widow of William de Whitchester; and, dying in 1402, was succeeded by his
son, Sir John Manners, who was Sheriff of Northumberland, and, with his son
John, was accused of the murder of William Heron and Robert Atkinson or
Akyman; they were prosecuted by Sir Robert de Umphreville, and Isabel,
widow of William Heron, and were ordered to “cause 500 masses to be sung
for the health of the soul of the same William Heron within one year then
next ensuing, and pay unto Sir Robert de Umphreville, and Isabel, to the use
of the said Isabel and her children by Heron, 200 marks.” He was succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
by his son Robert, who married Joan, daughter of Sir Robert Ogle, and had
issue by her, with others, a son, Robert, by whom he was succeeded. This
Sir Robert Manners married Eleanor, daughter of Thomas, Lord Roos (by
Philippa his wife, daughter of John, Lord Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester), and
sister and co-heiress of Edmund Lord Roos, “whereby he greatly increased
his estate, and among other possessions, had the ancient seat of Belvoir Castle,
built by Robert de Todenei, a noble Norman, on a stately ascent, overlooking
the beautiful valley adjacent (thence by him called <i>Belvoir</i>, from the fair view
of the country thereabouts), and it became the chief seat of that great barony,
bestowed on him by William the Conqueror; which seat and barony, in the
reign of Henry III., devolved upon Robert de Roos, a great baron, by marriage
with Isabel, daughter and heir of William de Albini, the fourth of that
name, descended from the said Robert de Todenei; and from the Lord Roos
it came to Sir Robert Manners by his marriage,” as did also many other
estates in other counties. The issue of this marriage was three daughters,
who each married into the family of Fairfax, and two sons. The eldest of
these sons was Sir George Manners, who, on the death of his mother, became
Lord Roos, and was also lineal heir to the baronies of Riveaulx, Trusbut, and
Belvoir. He married Anne, only daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas St. Leger,
by his wife Anne, daughter of Richard, Duke of York, and sister to King
Edward IV., and widow of John Holland, Duke of Exeter. By this lady,
who brought royal blood into the family, Sir George had a numerous family,
the eldest of whom succeeded him.</p>

<p>That was Sir Thomas Manners, who, on the death of his father, became
thirteenth Lord Roos of Hamlake, and Baron Trusbut, Riveaulx, and Belvoir.
He was with Henry VIII. and his Queen at the celebrated interview between
that monarch and the King of France at Guisnes, and in the same reign was
made Warden of the East Marches, and had many other honours granted him.
In the seventeenth year of the same monarch he was created Earl of Rutland&mdash;“a
title which none but the royal family had ever borne, and, by reason of
his descent from the sister of King Edward IV., had an augmentation to his
ancient arms,” <i>or</i>, two bars <i>azure</i>, and a chief, <i>gules</i>: which chief was augmented
thus:&mdash;quarterly <i>azure</i> and <i>gules</i>:&mdash;in the first and fourth two <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>,
and in the second and third a lion <i>passant guardant</i>, all <i>or</i>. He was also
installed a Knight of the Garter. A few years later this nobleman was present
at the second interview between Henry VIII. and Francis I.: he was also
present at the marriage of his sovereign with the ill-fated Anne Boleyn; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
later on, attended Anne of Cleves to England, and was made her chamberlain.
His lordship, who, besides the honours we have briefly indicated, took part in
most of the events of this stirring reign and held numerous important offices,
married twice, first, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Lovel; and second,
Eleanor, daughter of Sir William Paston, by the latter of whom only he had
issue. To the eldest and second of that issue we now refer.</p>

<p>The eldest son, Henry Manners, succeeded his father, in 1543, as second
Earl of Rutland. He was married twice: first to Margaret, daughter of the
fourth Earl of Westmoreland, by whom he had issue; and, second, to Bridget,
daughter of Lord Hussey, by whom he had no children. He was succeeded
by his eldest son, Edward Manners, as third Earl of Rutland, who, dying
without male issue, was succeeded by his brother, John Manners (the second
son of the second Earl), as fourth Earl of Rutland. This nobleman married
Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Charlton of Apsley, by whom he had issue,
with others, three sons&mdash;Roger Manners, Sir Francis Manners, and Sir George
Manners&mdash;who successively became fifth, six, and seventh Earls of Rutland.
All these dying without surviving male issue, the title passed to the
descendants of the second son of the first Earl.</p>

<p>Sir John Manners, second son of the first Earl of Rutland, and who was
consequently great grandson of the sister of King Edward IV., is the one
member of this illustrious family with whom Haddon is especially connected.
This John Manners, before he was knighted, became attached to
Dorothy Vernon, the youngest daughter and co-heiress of Sir George
Vernon of Haddon Hall, known far and wide as “the King of the Peak.”
Disguised, as we have already related, as a forester or woodman, John
Manners for some time lived in the woods about Haddon, in the hope
of obtaining occasional glimpses of, and stolen interviews with, Dorothy
Vernon; and at length so wooed that he won her, and carried her off on
horseback into his own county of Leicester, and there married her. The
story of this romantic elopement is one of the pleasantest episodes in the
history of Haddon, and will have again to be alluded to later on. By that
marriage the grand old mansion of Haddon Hall, and the Derbyshire property
of the “King of the Peak,” passed into the family of Manners, and helped to
swell its already large rent-roll of estates.</p>

<p>This John Manners, who was knighted in 1603, had issue by his wife,
Dorothy Vernon, three sons: Sir George Manners who succeeded him; John
Manners, who died at the age of fourteen years; Sir Roger Manners, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Whitwell; and Grace Manners, who married Sir Francis Fortescue, of Salden.
He died June 4th, 1611; his wife died in 1584.</p>

<p>Sir George Manners, their son, married Grace, daughter of Sir Henry
Pierrepoint, and sister to the Earl of Kingston, by whom he had issue, with
others, John Manners, his eldest son, who not only succeeded him, but also
succeeded his own cousin George, seventh Earl of Rutland, in his title and
estates, and thus became eighth Earl of Rutland. He married Frances,
daughter of Edward, Lord Montague of Boughton, by whom he had issue
four sons and seven daughters.</p>

<p>He was Sheriff of Derbyshire in the ninth and eleventh years of Charles I.,
and also represented that county in Parliament. His lordship was attached to
the Parliamentary interest during the Civil Wars, and was one of the twenty-two
peers who remained at Westminster when the king summoned both
houses to attend him at Oxford. As a consequence, his castle of Belvoir
was seized by the Royalists, and was held by them and Sir Gervase Lucas,
and here the king frequently resided; it was finally surrendered to the Parliamentarians
in January, 1645-6. In 1649 the castle was demolished, by
consent of the earl, who soon afterwards set about rebuilding it, which he
completed in 1668. During this time the earl lived principally at Haddon
Hall, where he died in 1679. Here he lived in a style of almost princely
magnificence, maintaining a large number of servants and retainers, and
dispensing, especially at Christmas time, his hospitality with a lavish hand.</p>

<p>About this time, from 1660 to 1670, although the family only occasionally
resided here, there were generally killed and consumed every year at Haddon
between thirty and forty beeves, from four to five hundred sheep, and a
number of swine, so that there was no lack of the good things of this world
for visitors to this hospitable place.</p>

<p>This nobleman was succeeded by his third and only surviving son, John
Manners, as ninth Earl of Rutland. This nobleman was born in 1638, and,
in 1679, was created a peer in his own right by the title of Baron Manners of
Haddon; and in September of the same year, his father dying, he became Earl
of Rutland. When twenty years of age he had married the Lady Anne Pierrepoint,
daughter of the Marquis of Dorchester, from whom he was afterwards
divorced; and married, secondly, Lady Diana Bruce, widow of Sir Seymour
Shirley, and daughter of the Earl of Aylesbury, who died in child-bed. His
lordship married, thirdly, Catherine, daughter of Baptist Noel, Viscount
Campden, by whom only he had surviving issue. He lived a country life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
and “kept up his old mansion at a bountiful old rate,” and in a style of even
greater magnificence and open-handedness than his father. It is said that at
Haddon alone he kept seven score of servants, and that every day saw his
grand old banqueting-hall filled to overflowing with retainers and guests. In
1703 the Earl was raised to the highest dignity in the realm, by the titles of
Marquis of Granby and Duke of Rutland. He died in January, 1710-11,
aged seventy-three, and was succeeded by his only surviving son, John
Manners.</p>

<p>John, second Duke of Rutland, when scarcely seventeen years of age, was
married to Katherine, second daughter of Lord William Russell, who was
beheaded in 1683. He then bore the title of Lord Roos; and the wedding
festivities seem, judging from some curious letters still extant concerning
them, to have been of the most lavishly extravagant character. This lady
who was sister to the Duchess of Devonshire and to the Duke of Bedford, gave
birth to five sons and four daughters, and died in child-bed, in 1711. The
Duke married, secondly, Lucy, daughter of Lord Sherard, and sister of the
Earl of Harborough, by whom also he had issue, six sons and two daughters:
his grace died in 1721, and was succeeded, as third Duke of Rutland, by his
eldest son, John Manners. This nobleman, who was born in 1696, married,
in 1717, Bridget, only daughter and heiress of Lord Lexington (an alliance
that gave him a large accession of estates), by whom he had issue thirteen
children, nearly all of whom died young.</p>

<p>He was the last of the family who made Haddon Hall a residence.</p>

<p>The estates of Lord Lexington having been settled upon the younger
branch of the family, the second and surviving sons, successively, took, by
Act of Parliament, the additional surname of Sutton, and thus founded the
family of Manners-Sutton.</p>

<p>The Duke, who was familiarly known as “the old man of the hill,” dying
in 1779, was succeeded by his grandson, Charles Manners, son of the celebrated
Marquis of Granby, Commander-in-chief of the British forces in
Germany, and Master of the Ordnance, who died during his father’s lifetime.
Charles, fourth Duke of Rutland, married Mary Isabella, daughter of Charles
Noel, Duke of Beaufort, by whom he had issue four sons&mdash;viz., John Henry,
who succeeded him, Charles Henry Somerset, Robert William, and William
Robert Albini; and two daughters&mdash;viz., the Lady Elizabeth Isabella, married
to Richard Norman, Esq., and Lady Catherine Mary, married to Lord Forester.
His grace died while holding office as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
succeeded by his eldest son&mdash;John Henry Manners, as fifth Duke of Rutland,
who married Elizabeth, daughter of the Earl of Carlisle, and by her had
issue, among others, his grace the present Duke of Rutland (third son, the
two elder ones having died before their father), and Lord John Manners, M.P.
His grace died in 1857, aged seventy-nine.</p>

<p>The present peer, Charles Cecil Manners, sixth Duke of Rutland, Marquis
of Granby, Earl of Rutland, and Baron Manners of Haddon, &amp;c., &amp;c., was
born in 1815, and has held many important appointments. His grace is not
married: the heir to the title and estates being his brother, Lord John Robert
Manners (Marquis of Granby, by courtesy), M.P. for North Leicestershire,
who is also known for the official posts he has held in the government of this
country.</p>

<p>The meadows around Haddon&mdash;with the river Wye twisting and turning
about in all imaginable forms&mdash;are very delightful, and some of the pleasantest
strolls conceivable may be taken along them, both up and down the stream,
which is full of fine trout, and is, therefore, a source of endless delight to the
angler.</p>

<p>Having thus given our readers as full an account as would appear necessary
both of the noble families to whom Haddon has belonged, and of the
Hall itself, and told them as much of its history as is requisite for our purpose,
we take leave of this interesting pile, and proceed to speak of one or
two matters connected with its immediate neighbourhood, before passing on
to the fine old church at Bakewell, where lie interred so many of the families
of Vernon and Manners.</p>

<p>Haddon has been a prolific theme for writers, and an endless source of
inspiration for poets and artists, and long will it continue to be so, for no
“olden” place can be more picturesque or more romantic. It is said that
Mrs. Radcliffe was so struck with it, that she laid the scene of her “Mysteries
of Udolpho” here; and Allan Cunningham, the Countess de Carabrella, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
numberless other writers, have made it a theme for some of their pleasantest
productions; William Bennett took it and its hospitable owner, Sir George
Vernon, as the subject of one of his most successful novels, “The King of the
Peak;” while D. Cox, Nash, Cattermole, Harding, Rayner, Morrison, and a
host of other artists, have added to their reputations by painting some of its
more attractive features.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Foot-Bridge.</i></p>
</div>

<p>As may naturally be expected, in a neighbourhood so rich in interest as
that of Haddon, some singular discoveries have at one time or other been
made. Among these the Roman altar, described on a preceding page, is perhaps
the most important.</p>

<p>The opening of barrows in the neighbourhood has brought to light many
interesting remains of the ancient British period, and also of Romano-British
times. These consist of interments in which have been found cinerary urns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
drinking-cups, bone mesh-rules, flint implements, bronze celts, and other
articles.</p>

<p>Some fine antlers, and parts of antlers, of the red deer, one of which, with
four points at the top, measured more than three feet along its outer curve,
and was six-and-a-half inches in medium circumference, have also been found.
But these are not the only remains of extinct animals found in the neighbourhood,
for those of the wild dog, the wild hog, the horse, the deer, the roebuck,
and the ox&mdash;both the <i>Bos urus</i> and the <i>Bos longifrons</i>&mdash;all of which
once ran wild in Derbyshire, have been found, in the course of deep draining
near the Hall, and preserved under the careful direction of Mr. Nesfield.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Ring found at Haddon Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most elegant relic yet discovered is the ring shown in our
engraving, which is in possession of his Grace the Duke of Rutland. It was
found a few years ago, not far from the “Bowling Green,” and is evidently
of the fifteenth century, and is of extremely fine workmanship and elegant
design. The hoop is wreathed, and has originally been enamelled, and bears
between the foliage the inscription, in old English letters, “de boen cuer,”
which is one of frequent occurrence as a posy upon mediæval rings, probably
in this case, meaning <i>de bon cœur</i>, and showing the hearty affection of the giver
to the receiver. The little figure engraved on the besel is St. John the Baptist,
with the Lamb enfolded in his mantle, and has most likely also been enamelled.
It is probably a kind of charm-ring&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a ring possessing physical or phylacteric
qualities against epilepsy, the <i>mal de St. Jean</i>. It is of the purest gold,
and weighs ninety-seven grains.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Washing-Tally found at Haddon Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Another interesting “find” was the Washing-Tally already referred to,
which is of the time of Charles I, and of extreme rarity. Of this tally, as
intimately connected with the inner and home life of Haddon, at the period of
the height of its hospitality and glory, we give the accompanying accurate
engraving, which is drawn of a somewhat reduced size, and for which, as for
the ring, and other engravings, our readers are indebted to the <i>Reliquary
Archæological Journal</i>, edited by Llewellynn Jewitt, F.S.A. This very interesting
relic is five-and-a-half inches in length and four-and-a-half inches in depth.
It is formed of a piece of beech-wood, a quarter of an inch in thickness, covered
with linen on the back and sides. Its construction is precisely that of a
“horn-book.” In front, the names of the different articles of clothing are
printed from a copper plate and protected by a sheet of horn. Around the
edge, a narrow slip of thin brass, fastened down with highly ornamented nails,
attaches the horn, the paper, and the linen, to the wood. The “tally” is
divided into fifteen squares, in each of which is a dial numbered from 0 to 12,
and above each square is the name of the article of clothing intended to be
taken into account. These are “Ruffes,” “Bandes,” “Cuffes,” “Handkercher,”
“Capps,” “Shirtes,” “Half-Shirtes,” “Boote-hose,” “Topps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>”
“Sockes,” “Sheetes,” “Pillowberes,” “Tableclothes,” “Napkins,” and
“Towells.” On each of the dials is a circular brass indicator, fastened by a
little pin in its centre, so as to be turned round at pleasure. Each indicator
is pierced on one side, close to the edge, with a round hole through which one
number only on the dial is visible at a time, and opposite to this hole is a
raised point by which the indicator can be turned as required.</p>

<p>It may here be well to note, that although Haddon Hall is no longer used
as a residence by the Duke of Rutland, he has within three or four miles of it
a delightful shooting-box, Stanton Woodhouse, pleasantly situated and charming
in every respect, where he and others of his family occasionally sojourn.
This and his other shooting-lodge, Longshawe, some distance across the moors
of the same county, are two charming retreats for the sportsman. It may be
mentioned, too, that at Rowsley, close at hand, is the admirably executed
effigy of Lady John Manners and her infant, by W. C. Marshall, R.A.</p>

<p>Passing on from Haddon to Bakewell, the tourist will not fail to notice the
Dove-cote on a mound near the road-side, and from this road-side he will
obtain one of the best and most charming views of the Hall to be gained
from any point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bakewell Church</span>, the burial-place of some of the members of the Vernon
and Manners families, to whom Haddon Hall successively belonged, is nearly
two miles distant from Haddon, and may be seen on looking up the valley of
the Wye. Bakewell itself is a pleasant and remarkably clean little market-town,
built on the banks of the Wye; there are several good public buildings
in the town itself, and many substantial residences in its neighbourhood. It
is, however, to the church only that we now desire to call attention in a short
description.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Bakewell Church.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is a cruciform building, of about 150 feet in length from west to east,
and about 105 feet in width across from wall to wall of the north and south
transepts, with a central tower and spire. It contains some extremely fine
Norman and Early-English features, and is lofty and remarkably well proportioned.
In the centre rises a noble tower, the lower part of which is square,
and the upper octagonal, with the angles boldly chamfered, and this is surmounted
by a lofty spire. There can be no doubt, from remains which have
been found, that a church had existed on this spot from very early pre-Norman
times. In Domesday survey, it is stated there were two priests for the church
of Bakewell. It was afterwards made a collegiate church. It was granted by
William the Conqueror to William Peverel, his natural son, but was, with the
other immense possessions of that family, forfeited by attainder by one of his
descendants in 1154; it remained in the possession of the crown till it was
given by Richard I., on his accession to the throne in 1189, to his brother
John, Earl of Morteigne, afterwards King John. To him is traditionally
ascribed the rebuilding of the nave (with the exception of the west end, which
he is said to have left standing), and its endowment; but it is more probable
that it was built and endowed by a Peverel, who gave part of the Bakewell
tithes to Lenton Priory. In 1192, Earl John gave the church, with all its
prebends and other appurtenances, to the present cathedral of Lichfield. In
1365, a chantry was founded in the church by Sir Godfrey Foljambe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Avena his wife, whose beautiful little monument will be seen on one of the
piers of the nave. The nave, which was erected probably about 1110, is
separated from the side-aisles by semicircular arches, rising from piers of solid
masonry instead of pillars. At the west end is a fine Norman doorway ornamented
with beak-head mouldings and other characteristic features.</p>

<p>The church was extensively repaired and restored in 1841, when numerous
very interesting remains were brought to light. These included an extensive
series of incised sepulchral slabs, of very early date, bearing crosses of various
forms, and many interesting devices; several ancient crosses used as headstones;
a considerable and extremely beautiful assemblage of fragments of
encaustic paving tiles; and several fragments of coped tombs, and of crosses
with the interlaced ornament so characteristic of the Saxon period, as well as
many stone coffins, and sculptured fragments of mouldings, capitals, &amp;c.,
belonging to the more ancient edifice.</p>

<p>Of these curious remains the greater part were preserved in the porch of
the church, and consist of considerably more than fifty incised slabs&mdash;some of
which are perfect, and others in fragments&mdash;and perhaps a score or two of
other stones. It is also stated, and is much to be regretted, that at least four
times the number of sculptured stones preserved were rebuilt into the walls
during the alterations, so that, including a number taken away and now preserved
at Lomberdale, there must have been from three to four hundred
found. In the same porch, a selection of the ornamented paving tiles is also
preserved; among the patterns are many of extreme beauty and elegance.</p>

<p>The font is also deserving of especial notice. It is octagonal, each of its
sides bearing a figure beneath a crocketed canopy. A fragment of another
ancient font will be seen in the porch.</p>

<p>The part of Bakewell Church, however, with which we have now particularly
to do is the <span class="smcap">Vernon Chapel</span>, in which, divided from the south
transept by a beautiful open oak screen, lie buried the later Vernons and the
earlier members of the Manners family connected with Haddon. This chapel
was, it appears, erected “late in the Decorated period, about 1360, upon the
walls of the former chapel. The Early-English half-pillars at each extremity
of the arches had been retained, and were very beautiful examples, well
worthy of imitation. The hollows of the mouldings, up to a certain height,
being filled with bold roses, capitals in a different style were afterwards added
to suit the decorated arches. The central pillars, with their central clustered
shafts, are of singularly elegant design; the tracery of the windows partakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
of the flamboyant character. The upper part of the buttresses was also
altered to correspond with the new work.” It will bear comparison with any
structure of the kind in England, and has been rebuilt in good taste.</p>

<p>In the centre of the Vernon Chapel stands a fine altar-tomb, bearing the
recumbent effigies of Sir George Vernon, the “King of the Peak,” and his
two wives, Margaret Taylebois and Maude Langford. This tomb is an
extremely beautiful and characteristic example of the elaborately decorated
monuments of the period to which it belongs. Along its sides, under a
series of canopied arches, are figures bearing shields of the arms of the
Vernons and their alliances and those of the families of his two wives. Sir
George is habited in plate armour and surcoat, and wears a straight long
beard and straight hair. He has a double chain and a sword. The inscription
on this interesting tomb is as follows:&mdash;“Here lyeth S<sup>r</sup> George Vernon,
Knight, deceased ye &mdash;&mdash; daye of &mdash;&mdash; an<sup>o</sup> 1561, and Dame Margaret his
wyffe, daughter of Sir Gylbert Tayleboys, deceased ye &mdash;&mdash; daye of &mdash;&mdash;  156&mdash;;
and also dame Mawde his wyffe, dawght<sup>r</sup> to S<sup>r</sup> Ralphe Langford, deceased ye
&mdash;&mdash; daye of &mdash;&mdash; anno 156&mdash; whose solles God pdon.” The inscription, it
will be seen, has never been finished, the blanks for the dates not having been
filled up. The surcoat worn by the knight is elaborately emblazoned with his
own arms with all its quarterings; and, taken altogether, this is a remarkably
fine and interesting monument.</p>

<p>At the south end of the chapel stands, to visitors to Haddon, perhaps the
most interesting of its monuments. It is that of Dorothy Vernon, about whose
elopement we have already discoursed, and her husband, Sir John Manners,
with their children. This lady, it will be recollected, was one of the daughters
and co-heiresses of Sir George Vernon, whose monument we have just been
describing, and his first wife Margaret Taylebois, and by her marriage with
Sir John Manners, she conveyed Haddon Hall and the other Derbyshire estates
of the Vernons to the family of Manners, to whom they still belong. This
monument we, for the first time, engrave. It is a large and very imposing-looking
erection. At the top, in the centre, is a large shield, bearing the
shield of Manners, with its sixteen quarterings, and on either side is an obelisk
ornament, one of which bears the arms of Manners and the other of Vernon.
Beneath these is a bold cornice and ornamental frieze, on which again occur
three shields with the arms, respectively, in the centre Manners impaling
Vernon; and on one side Avenell, and on the other Roos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>Monument of Sir John Manners and his wife, Dorothy Vernon.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This cornet and frieze surmount a semicircular arch, beneath which are
the kneeling figures, facing each other, of Sir John Manners, in plate armour,
and his wife, Dorothy Vernon, in close-fitting dress, with cap, and frill or ruff
around the neck. Between them there is a pedestal, bearing the following
incription:&mdash;“Here lyeth S<sup>r</sup> John Manners, of Haddon, Knight, second sonne
of Thoas, Erle of Rutland, who dyed the 4 of June, 1611, and Dorothie his
wife, one of the daughters and heires to S<sup>r</sup> George Vernon, of Haddon, Knight,
who deceased the 24 day of June, in the 26 yere of the raigne of Queen
Elizabeth, 1584.” Above the pedestal is a large shield, with quarterings of
the armorial bearings of the families of Manners and Vernon and their alliances;
the shields bearing the sixteen quarterings of Manners, differenced with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
crescent, impaled with the twelve quarterings of Vernon. On the spandrels
are also shields of arms, the one bearing Manners quartering Roos and two
others; and the other, Vernon quartering Avenel and two others. The lower
part of the monument contains four figures of the children of Sir John and his
wife Dorothy, and two shields, the one bearing the arms of Manners, and the
other those of Vernon.</p>

<p>At the opposite or north end of the chapel is a much larger and more pretentious
monument, that of Sir George Manners, son and heir of Sir John
Manners and Dorothy Vernon, and of his wife, Grace Pierrepoint. At the top
is a large shield bearing the arms of Manners with its sixteen quarterings, and
on each side is an obelisk. Beneath these is a massive and bold cornice,
supported on Corinthian pillars, forming a recess in which is a semicircular
arch, elaborately carved, and over it the inscription, “The day of a man’s
death is better than the day of his birth.” Under this arch and cornice are
the effigies of Sir George Manners and his wife, kneeling, and facing each
other, while between them is a double desk, or lectern, on the front of which
are the words&mdash;“Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up before thee,” and a
shield bearing the arms of Manners impaling Pierrepoint. Behind the figures,
on a tablet, is a Latin inscription, which has been thus translated:&mdash;“Sir
George Manners of Haddon, Knt., here waits the resurrection of the just in
Christ. He married Grace, second daughter of Sir Henry Pierrepoint, Knt.,
who afterwards bore to him four sons and five daughters, and lived with him
in holy wedlock thirty years. She caused him to be buried with his forefathers,
and then placed this monument, at her own expense, as a perpetual
memorial of their conjugal faith, and she joined the figure of his body with
hers, having vowed their ashes and bones should be laid together. He died
23rd April, 1623, aged 54. She died &mdash;&mdash;.” Sir George is represented in
armour, and his lady is habited in close dress, with ruff, hood or coif, and long
veil. Beneath the figures of the knight and his lady, the monument is divided
into two heights, each of which is formed into an arcade holding the effigies of
their children. The upper arcade consists of four semicircular arches, with
shields of armorial bearings in the spandrels. Within the first of these arches
is the effigy of the eldest son&mdash;a “chrisom child”&mdash;who died in infancy and
is, as usual, represented bound up, mummy fashion, in swaddling-clothes; in
the second, the kneeling effigy, in armour, of John Manners, who ultimately
succeeded to the title of eighth Earl of Rutland; and in the third and fourth,
those of two of the daughters. In the lower arcade, which is formed of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
archways, the first two being semicircular and the remaining three pointed,
are respectively the kneeling effigies of Henry Manners, who died at the age
of fourteen, and is habited as a youth; Roger Manners, in armour; and three
daughters. In the spandrels of the arches, as in the upper arcade, are a series
of shields with armorial bearings. Over the nine arches are the nine inscriptions
as follows:&mdash;Over the “chrisom child,” “Mine age is nothing in respect
of thee;” over the son and heir, “One generation passeth and another
cometh;” over the youth, Henry Manners, “My days were but a span
long;” over the fourth son, Roger, “By the grace of God I am what I am;”
over the daughters, beginning with the eldest, “A virtuous woman is a crown
to her husband,” “The wise woman buildeth her house,” “A gracious
woman retaineth honour,” “A prudent wife is from the Lord,” and “She
that feareth the Lord shall be praised.” On the pedestal by Sir George,
“Christ is to me both in death and life an advantage,” and on the opposite
one, by his wife, “I shall go to him, he shall not return to me.” The arms
on the shields are those of Manners, differenced with a crescent; Pierrepoint;
Manners impaling Montague; Sutton impaling Manners; Howard impaling
Manners; and the other alliances also impaled.</p>

<p>On the wall is a memorial to John Manners, son of Dorothy Vernon and
her husband, Sir John Manners, with the inscription&mdash;“Heare lieth buried
John Manners, gentleman, third son of S<sup>r</sup> John Manners, Knight, who died
the xvi day of July, in the yeere of our Lord God 1590, being of the age
of 14 yeers.”</p>

<p>The most ancient, and certainly one of the most interesting, monuments in
the church, is that of Sir Thomas de Wendesley, or Wensley, of Wensley, who
was killed at the battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. It is an altar-tomb, with the
recumbent effigy of the knight in plate armour, wearing the conical helmet or
bascinet, and camail or tippet of chain mail, with gussets of the same at the
arm-pits. His girdle, which is exceedingly rich, encircles his hips; the sword
is lost, but the dagger remains. His surcoat is emblazoned with his arms, and
he wears the collar of SS. On the front of the helmet is inscribed <span class="smcap lowercase">IHO
NAZAREN</span>.</p>

<p>In the chancel is an altar-tomb to John Vernon, 1477, the inscription on
which runs as follows:&mdash;“Hic jacet Johis Vernon filius et heres Henrici
Vernon qui obiit xii die mensis Augusti Anno Dni Mo cccclxxvii cuj anime
piciet̄ dē;” and in the Vernon Chapel is an incised slab, with the arms of
Eyre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>In the nave is a small but exceedingly beautiful monument bearing the
half-length effigies, side by side, under an elaborately-crocketed canopy, of
Sir Godfrey Foljambe and Avena his wife. The knight is represented in
armour, with conical helmet or bascinet, and tippet of chain mail; his surcoat
bearing the arms of Foljambe. The lady wears a reticulated caul. In each
of the spandrels is a shield, the one bearing the arms of Foljambe, the other
that of the family of Ireland, of Hartshorne, to which the lady belonged.</p>

<p>There are several tablets and inscriptions in various parts of the church
which are worthy of a passing glance, and there are also some memorial
stained-glass windows of good design. Among these is one in memory of the
late Duke of Rutland, representing the Resurrection, bearing the following
inscription:&mdash;“The above window was erected, by subscription, in memory of
John Henry, Duke of Rutland, who died 20th January, 1857, aged seventy-nine
years.” Others are put in to the memory of the late Mr. Allcard and of
Mr. Jonathan Wilson and others.</p>

<p>Before leaving the interior of this fine old church, it will, no doubt, interest
the visitor to be told in fewer words, and more correctly than could be gleaned
from the strange tales sometimes told in the place, the story of the uncovering
of the remains of Dorothy Vernon, her husband, and other members of the
family, during the rebuilding and alteration of the church. When the excavations
were commenced on the site of the monument of Sir John Manners and
his wife Dorothy Vernon, the remains of two persons, supposed to be the
knight and his lady, were found; the skull of the one was identified as that of
Sir John, by its peculiar form and its likeness to his sculptured effigy; that of
the other, which lay near it, with beautiful auburn hair still attached, among
which were some pins that had been used to fasten it&mdash;was naturally, and no
doubt correctly, considered to be that of the once lovely Dorothy. In another
part three children’s leaden coffins were found, but not opened, and the bones
of an infant (probably the “chrisom child,” represented on the tomb of Sir
George Manners) were discovered rolled up in a sheet of lead. These, no
doubt, were the children of different members of the Manners family. A
leaden coffin was also found which contained the body of a lady. The part of
the lid over the head had been violently torn away&mdash;the piece of the sheet of
lead being missing&mdash;and this was carefully and thoroughly examined. The
body had been buried in lime, but the part of the lid had been torn off, the
head cut off, taken out and surgically examined, and then hastily replaced,
but with the face downwards. The rest of the body was undisturbed. Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
other bodies were, of course, found, as were some few other interesting matters
which require no notice here.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Ancient Cross, Bakewell Churchyard.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the churchyard, near the east wall of the south transept, stands one of
the finest so-called “Runic crosses” in the kingdom. It is, exclusive of the
modern pedestal, about eight feet in height: the upper limb of the cross is
broken off. Of this fine old cross we give an engraving. The front of the
cross, which in bad taste has been turned towards the wall, is sculptured in
four heights, with figures beneath arches&mdash;the upper group being the Crucifixion:
the whole, however, is much defaced. The opposite side, the one
shown in our engraving, is boldly
sculptured, with a beautiful scroll-pattern
of foliage terminating at the
top in an animal, and at the bottom
is a cross within a circle; on the
head is a figure on horseback. The
sides of the cross are sculptured in
scroll-work of foliage, of much the
same design as the side just described;
the end of one of the limbs
bears an interlaced ornament, and
the other a figure. This cross, and
the one at Eyam, a few miles distant,
are among the most perfect
and beautiful remaining examples
of the early period to which they
belong.</p>

<p>If the tourist still wishes to
linger for a few minutes in the
churchyard, he will find much to
interest, to please, and to amuse
him. To <i>interest</i> him in examining
the external features of the church,
especially the Norman doorway and arcade, &amp;c., at the west end, and the
beautiful doorway of Early-English design on the south side, as well as the
stone coffins grouped together in one corner. To <i>please</i> him, in the magnificent
view he obtains of the surrounding country, especially of the valley of
the Wye as it runs its zig-zag course towards Haddon; and to <i>amuse</i> him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
in reading the strange verses which occur on some of the grave-stones which
crowd around him on every side, and in the church itself.</p>

<p>One of these, to the memory of a former parish clerk and leader of the
choir, reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">“<span class="smcap">Erected to the Memory of Philip Roe, who died 12th September, 1815,<br />
Aged 52 Years.</span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The vocal Powers, here let us mark,<br />
Of <span class="smcap">Philip</span>, our late Parish Clerk.<br />
In church, none ever heard a Layman<br />
With a clearer Voice say Amen!<br />
Oh! who with Hallelujah’s Sound<br />
Like Him can make the Roofs resound.<br />
The Choir lament his Choral Tones,<br />
The Town&mdash;so soon here lie his Bones.<br />
Sleep undisturbed, within thy peaceful shrine,<br />
Till angels wake thee with such tones as thine.”</p>

<p class="p1">Another long inscription to the memory of John Dale, barber-surgeon,
of Bakewell, and his two wives, Elizabeth Foljambe and Sarah Bloodworth,
1757, thus curiously ends:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Know, posterity, that on the 8th of April, in the year of grace 1757, the rambling
remains of the above-said John Dale were, in the 86th yeare of his pilgrimage, laid upon
his two wives.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“This thing in life might raise some jealousy,<br />
Here all three lie together lovingly,<br />
But from embraces here no pleasure flows,<br />
Alike are here all human joys and woes;<br />
Here Sarah’s chiding John no longer hears,<br />
And old John’s rambling Sarah no more fears;<br />
A period’s come to all their toilsome lives,<br />
The good man’s quiet; still are both his wives.”</p>

<p class="p1">Another reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“These lines I with watery eye</p>
<p class="pp7">For my dear friend indite,</p>
<p class="pp6">Who for his worth, none such on earth,</p>
<p class="pp7">Heaven crown him with true light.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“A lawyer just, a steward most just,</p>
<p class="pp7">As ever sate in court,</p>
<p class="pp6">Who lived beloved, with tears interred,</p>
<p class="pp7">This is his true report.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Another, locally said to have been written by Charles Wesley, brother to
the founder of Methodism, reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Beneath, a sleeping infant lies,</p>
<p class="pp7">To earth whose body lent,</p>
<p class="pp6">More glorious shall hereafter rise,</p>
<p class="pp7">Though not more innocent;</p>

<p class="pp7">And souls to bodies join,</p>
<p class="pp6">Thousands shall wish their lives below</p>
<p class="pp7">Had been as short as thine.”</p>

<p class="p1">It may be as well to note that the principal inn at Bakewell is the Rutland
Arms: it is a family hotel, but there are other comfortable inns in the place.
Opposite the Rutland Arms are the baths and bath-gardens: the baths, which
were known to the Romans, have the reputation of being efficacious in rheumatism.</p>

<p>Having already very briefly alluded to the routes by which Haddon Hall
may be visited both from Buxton on the one hand, and from Derby on the
other, and having then spoken of some of the attractions of Buxton, it may be
well now to say a few words regarding Matlock Bath, through which the
visitor will pass by rail on his journey from London, from Derby, or from the
North.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matlock Bath</span> is about seven miles from Haddon Hall; and, exclusive of
its baths, which are as famous as those of Buxton, and for the benefit of which
the invalid may pass the season pleasantly and profitably, it has attractions
of scenery which no other inland watering-place can boast. Its “High Tor”
rising almost perpendicularly to a height of about 400 feet above the river
Derwent, which flows at its base; its “Lovers’ Walks,” winding along by the
side of the river, and zig-zagging up the mountain side; its “Heights of
Abraham” and “Masson” towering over the valley: its “romantic rocks,” and
its many caverns; its petrifying wells, its “grottoes,” and its other attractions,
render Matlock Bath a place of delight to the tourist; while the surrounding
district, rich in minerals, in ferns, and in other botanical specimens,
and full of gorgeous scenery, is “passing beautiful,” and will amply repay the
pleasant labour of exploring.</p>

<p>At Matlock Bath the principal hotels are the “New Bath,” “Walker’s
Terrace Hotel,” “The Temple,” and “Hodgkinson’s,” and the place swarms
with lodging-houses and all things to attract and to keep the tourist. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Matlock, delightful day-trips may be made to Haddon Hall, to Hardwick Hall,
to Chatsworth, the “Palace of the Peak”&mdash;the princely seat of the Duke of
Devonshire; to Dovedale, with its glorious scenery, and its pleasant associations
with old Izaac Walton and Charles Cotton; to the Via Gellia and its
surroundings; to Lea Hurst, the early home of Florence Nightingale; and
to numberless other places of interest&mdash;all easily attainable by railroad or
carriage.</p>

<p>And now, may not a visit to this grand old Hall be productive of thought?
First, let us give thanks to the noble owner&mdash;the Duke of Rutland&mdash;that he
freely opens its gates to all comers, keeps it in a state of neatness and order,
and takes special care that Time shall make no farther inroads on the mansion
of his ancestors, preserving it for the enjoyment of all who seek instruction
and pleasure there; permitting them, indeed, to make of one of its rooms
a dinner-room for the day; rendering it, in fact, the common property of the
public, and by his occasional presence ascertaining that all is done that can be
done for their happiness while in its gardens or within its walls: thus practically
commenting on the exhortation and protest of the Poet-laureate&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Why don’t those acred sirs<br />
Throw up their parks some dozen times a year,<br />
And let the people breathe?”</p>

<p class="dc13">HATFIELD is entitled to high rank among the
Stately Homes of England, whether we consider
its architectural merits, its historical associations,
or the picturesque attractions by which it is
surrounded. Seven centuries have passed since
Hatfield became a place of note; and the crown,
the mitre, and the coronet have successively held
sway over its destinies. Of its architectural glories,
little now remains of a date anterior to that
of James I., in whose reign the present noble
house was built. A part, however, of the previous
<i>palace</i> of Hatfield still exists, interesting as the
home of the Princess Elizabeth, during the reign
of her sister, Queen Mary. Nor was her residence
here, though compulsory, a state of imprisonment and
oppression, as some have said; for it is proved, from
various records, that she met with considerate treatment,
and lived in a state befitting her lofty rank and
queenly prospects, till, on the death of Mary, she proceeded
hence to take possession of the throne of England.</p>

<p>Hatfield House lies some twenty miles from London, in
the county of Hertford, and is the seat of the most noble
the Marquis of Salisbury&mdash;the representative of the grand old line of the
Cecils. The history of the mansion is one of considerable interest, dating,
as its name <i>Hetfelle</i> indicates, from Saxon times, and undergoing many
changes under its royal and noble and ecclesiastical owners. It belonged
to the Saxon kings until, in the reign of Edgar, it was given by that
monarch to the monastery of St. Etheldreda, at Ely, which was founded
in 673, destroyed in 870, and refounded in 970, and erected into a
bishopric in 1108, in the reign of Henry I.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Old Palace at Hatfield.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus Hatfield being attached
to the new bishopric, and the manor becoming one of the many residences
of the prelates, acquired, it is said, its appellation of “Bishop’s Hatfield.”
Hatfield continued to be one of the palaces of the Bishops of Ely, and was
occasionally used as a royal residence, until the reign of Henry VIII.,
when it was made over to the crown. “William de Hatfield, second son of
Edward the Third, was born at the palace,” and at various times before it
finally became vested in the crown, it was used and frequented by royalty.
During the latter part of the reign of Henry VIII. the young Prince Edward,
afterwards Edward VI., resided at this palace, and is variously stated to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
been here and at Hertford when the news of the death of his father was conveyed
to him, and when, consequently, his accession to the crown took place.
In the fourth year of his reign the youthful monarch conveyed Hatfield to his
sister, the Princess Elizabeth, afterwards Queen Elizabeth, and here she
frequently resided. Indeed, the greater part of the troublous reign of Mary,
the Princess passed at Hatfield, “with few privations and no personal hardships
to endure,” but with much mental torture; for it must not be forgotten
that she had been removed from Ashbridge to London and imprisoned in the
Tower, for her supposed participation in Wyatt’s rebellion, and was then,
under surveillance, permitted to retire to Hatfield. It was at Hatfield that
Elizabeth, it is said, while seated under an oak, received the welcome intelligence
of the death of her sister, “the bloody Queen” Mary, and on hearing
the news she fell upon her knees, exclaiming in Latin, <i>A Domino factum est
istud, et est mirabile oralis nostris</i> (“It is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous
in our eyes”), words which she adopted as a motto for her gold coinage,
while on her silver issue she chose the somewhat similar one, <i>Posui Deum
adjutorem meum</i> (“I have chosen God for my helper”). Thus Hatfield became
identified with the coinage of the realm as well as with many of its rulers.
The day following this event Elizabeth was waited upon at Hatfield by several
noblemen of the late queen’s Council, whom she received very kindly, “but
presently showed her decided preference for Sir William Cecil (afterwards
Lord Burleigh)&mdash;the astute, the most politic Cecil&mdash;whom she instantly
appointed principal Secretary of State.” On the 23rd of November the Queen
removed from Hatfield with an escort of more than a thousand persons, and
made her progress by slow degrees to Somerset House.</p>

<p>In 1587 Elizabeth had, it is recorded, been visited at Hatfield by Mary,
whom she received with much state, and with great festivity, playing herself
upon the virginals, to accompany a child who sang. It was at Hatfield, too,
it is said, that Elizabeth received the proposals of marriage from the King of
Sweden for his son Eric, which she turned to such profitable account with her
sister by declaring that she would never listen to any overtures of this nature
which had not previously received her Majesty’s sanction.</p>

<p>It does not appear that after her accession to the throne Queen Elizabeth
ever resided at Hatfield, although she had previously been much attached to
the place, and had kept up Christmas revels and Shrovetide and other festivities
in a liberal manner. At one of these, Sir Thomas Pope, her guardian,
made “for the Ladie Elizabeth, alle at his own costes, a greate and rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
maskinge, in the great hall at Hatfielde, where the pageauntes were marvelously
furnished” with “banket of sweete dishes,” “a suttletie in thirty
spyce,” and wonderful garnishings, but for which “folliries” Sir Thomas got
“snubbed” by his queen, who ordered these mummeries to cease.</p>

<p>James I., in the third year of his reign, exchanged Hatfield for the house,
manor, and park of Theobalds, with his minister, Sir Robert Cecil, afterwards
created Earl of Salisbury, whose descendant, the Marquis of Salisbury, is the
present owner, the estates passing in regular succession from that time to the
present day, and continuing to be the principal residence of that noble family,
about whom we now give some details.</p>

<p>The family of Cecil is one of considerable antiquity, and many of its
members have distinguished themselves both in statesmanship, in the field,
and in the arena of literature. The greatness of the family was laid by Sir
William Cecil, the friend and adviser of Queen Elizabeth before she came to
the throne, and her first chief Secretary of State. “This distinguished statesman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>”
says Sir Robert Naunton, “was the son of a younger brother of the
Cecills of Hertfordshire, a family of my own knowledge, though now private,
yet of no mean antiquity, who, being exposed and sent to the city, as poor
gentlemen used to do their sons, became to be a rich man on London Bridge,
and purchased (estates) in Lincolnshire where this man was born.” First he
became Secretary to the Protector Somerset, and afterwards, on the accession
of Elizabeth, he was appointed Secretary of State. In 1561 he was made
President of the Court of Wards. His great talent and assiduity won for him
much regard at court, where he was treated with great favour. In 1571 he
was created Lord Burleigh, and continued to maintain his distinguished
position in the state till his death. He resided chiefly at Theobalds, where he
often had the honour of entertaining his sovereign, who was “sene in as
great royalty, and served as bountifully and magnificently, as at anie other
tyme or place, all at his lordship’s chardge,” &amp;c. The events in the life of
this statesman are so closely associated with the history of England itself in
the stirring times in which he lived, that they are too well known to need
more than a passing notice. After being mixed up in every affair of state
from some time before the accession of Elizabeth, having taken part in all the
proceedings connected with the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots, and with
his own hand drawn up her death-warrant, and after having for forty years
mainly directed the councils of the “Virgin Queen,” Sir William Cecil, now
Lord Burleigh, died on the 4th of August, 1598, in the seventh-eighth year of
his age, to the great grief of Elizabeth, who is said to have wept bitter tears at
his death.</p>

<p>The eldest son of Lord Treasurer Burleigh succeeded him in his title,
which has since been augmented by the Earldom and Marquisate of Exeter;
while his youngest son, Sir Robert Cecil, inherited much of his father’s talent
and wisdom, “with a more subtle policy and a superior capacity for state
intrigue.” For certain secret services to James, during the life of Elizabeth,
he was raised by the king to the peerage. In 1604 he was created Viscount
Cranborne, and, in the year following, he was made Earl of Salisbury. After
filling the office of sole Secretary of State, he succeeded, on the death of the
Earl of Dorset, to the high post of Lord Treasurer. “Shrewd, subtle, and
penetrating,” he discharged his duties with great ability, and while attending
to the interests of his country, forgot not his own, having, “by various
methods,” increased his inheritance to a very ample extent.</p>

</div>

<p>After taking a
prominent part in the affairs of state during Elizabeth’s reign, he was the one
who, on her death-bed, succeeded in inducing her to name her successor.
Cecil, who was then her Secretary, approached her bed with the lord-keeper
and the lord-admiral, and begged the dying Queen to name her successor,
when she started and said, “I told you my seat had been the seat of kings;
I will have no <i>rascal</i> to succeed me!”&mdash;when Cecil boldly asked her what
she meant by “no rascal?”&mdash;to which she replied, a king should succeed
her, and who could that be but her cousin of Scotland? and she begged to be
no more troubled. Nevertheless, some hours later Cecil again “besought
her, if she would have the King of Scots to succeed her, she would show a
sign unto them, whereat, suddenly heaving herself up in her bed, she held
both her hands joined together over her head in manner of a crown. Then
she sank down, fell into a doze, and at three o’clock in the morning died in a
stupor.” Five hours after her death, Cecil proclaimed James of Scotland,
King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and thus at once secured the country against conflicting claimants to the
crown. Soon afterwards he received the new monarch at Theobalds, who a
few days later rewarded him by important offices, and by creating him Baron
Cecil and afterwards Viscount Cranborne and Earl of Salisbury. From the
moment of James’s accession, through all the troublous times of the gunpowder
plot, and all the matters relating to Lady Arabella Stuart, to Sir
Walter Raleigh, and others, down to 1612, Cecil’s was one of the most prominent
names in the kingdom. In that year “he died, worn out and
wretched, at Marlborough, on his way back to court.” In his last moments
he said, “Ease and pleasure quake to hear of death; but my life, full of cares
and miseries, desireth to be dissolved.” It was this nobleman who exchanged
his mansion of Theobalds, with the king, for Hatfield. On his death, his
title and estates descended to his only son, William Cecil, who became second
Earl of Salisbury; and, dying in 1688, was succeeded by James Cecil, as third
Earl of Salisbury. The fourth Earl of Salisbury, also named James, died in
1694, and his great grandson, James Cecil, the seventh Earl, was created
Marquis of Salisbury by George III., in 1789. This nobleman had succeeded
his father in 1780. He married the Lady Mary Amelia Hill, second daughter
of the Marquis of Downshire, by whom he had issue a son, who succeeded
him, and two daughters. He died in 1823, and was succeeded, as second
Marquis of Salisbury, by his only son, James Brownlow Williams Cecil,
Viscount Cranborne, who was born in 1791. His lordship married, first, in
1821, Frances Mary Gascoigne, daughter and heiress of Bamber Gascoigne,
Esq., and assumed the surname of Gascoigne-Cecil. By this marriage he had
issue three sons, Lord James Emilius William Evelyn Gascoigne-Cecil (who
died during the lifetime of his father), Lord Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoigne-Cecil,
the present Marquis, and Lord Eustace Brownlow Henry Gascoigne-Cecil,
M.P.; and two daughters, the Lady Mildred Arabella Charlotte Henrietta,
married to A. J. B. Beresford Hope, M.P., and the Lady Blanche Mary Harriet,
married to the late J. M. Balfour, Esq. The marquis married secondly, in 1847,
the Lady Mary Catherine Sackville-West, daughter of Earl Delawarr, by whom
he had issue three sons and two daughters, Lords Sackville Arthur, Arthur,
and Lionel; and Ladies Mary Isabella (married to the Earl of Galloway), and
Margaret Elizabeth. His lordship died in 1868, and his widow, the Marchioness
of Salisbury, was re-married, in 1870, to the present Earl of Derby. He was
succeeded by his son, the present peer.</p>

<p>Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoigne-Cecil, third Marquis and sixth Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Salisbury, Viscount Cranborne, and Baron Cecil, Chancellor of the University
of Oxford, was born in 1830, was educated at Eton and at Christ Church,
Oxford (B.A., 1850, M.A. and Fellow of All Souls’ College, 1853), and in
1853 was returned to parliament as M.P. for Stamford, for which place he sat
until, in 1868, he succeeded to the title. In 1866-7 he held the office of
Secretary of State for India, and still holds many important local appointments.
In 1857 his lordship married Georgina, daughter of Sir Edward Hall
Alderson, Baron of the Court of Exchequer, by whom he has issue living four
sons, viz., James Edward Hubert, Viscount Cranborne, born 1861; Rupert
William Ernest, born 1863; Algernon Edward Robert, born 1864, and another
born 1869; and two daughters, Beatrix, born in 1858, and Gwendolen, born
in 1860. His lordship is patron of eight livings in Hertfordshire, Dorsetshire,
and Essex. The arms of the Marquis of Salisbury are quarterly, first and
fourth <span class="smcap">Cecil</span>, viz., barry of ten, <i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>, over all six escutcheons,
three, two and one, <i>sable</i>, each charged with a lion rampant, <i>argent</i>, a crescent,

<p>Hatfield House is of vast extent; it is of brick, with stone dressings. It
was built between the years 1605 and 1611 by Robert Cecil, first Earl of
Salisbury. After being suffered to fall into decay, it was restored and beautified
by the sixth earl, about the middle of the last century.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In 1835, a
great part of the west wing was destroyed by fire (in which the Dowager
Marchioness of Salisbury perished), little being left of that part of the house
besides the outer walls. On this disaster occurring, occasion was taken to
effect a general reparation of the entire building. The house is built in the
form of a half H, comprising a centre and two wings, the hollow part being
turned towards the south. The centre is a magnificent example of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Palladian style, and, although of mixed architecture, presents, in its totality,
a design of great richness and beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>The East View.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The basement-story contains an arcade with eight arches, divided externally
by pilasters, whereof the upper parts are fluted, and the lower parts
enriched with Elizabethan arabesques. The lower pilasters are Doric, the
upper Ionic. The wings are massive and comparatively plain, supported at
each corner by square turrets, seventy feet high to the gilded vanes: the
space between, comprising three stories, is relieved by a fine oriel window of
two stories. The centre tower, over the grand entrance, is also seventy feet
high; it has three stories with coupled columns at the corners, the whole
having an agreeable pyramidal effect. The third story of the tower contains
a clock, and also the armorial bearings of the founder, with the date 1611, in
which year the present house was finished. The length of the southern front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
is 300 feet, the centre being 140 feet, and each wing 80 feet wide, with a
projection from the centre of 100 feet.</p>

<p>The northern front is plain&mdash;a severe simplicity, nearly allied to grandeur,
being its chief characteristic; the centre compartment, with its entrance-doorway
below and noble clock-tower above, being the only elaboration it
contains.</p>

<p>The south front contains the principal entrance, and, from its symmetry
and ornate character, is, architecturally at least, the principal one. The east
front has, however, certain advantages, which go far towards making it the
most interesting, as it certainly is the most picturesque. The view in that
direction, whether from the house or of it, is by far the most pleasing, as the
founder well knew when he caused the principal apartments to be placed on
this side. The scene from these rooms is of remarkable interest and variety;
first there is a noble terrace-walk, with enriched parapet, over which the eye
wanders at will among the clustering flowers of the Elizabethan garden, and
from thence to the maze, beyond which is the park, with its fine sheet of
water surrounded by noble old trees.</p>

<p>Entering the mansion the visitor is admitted into a spacious <span class="smcap">Hall</span> which
leads to the <span class="smcap">Gallery</span>, in which are preserved many interesting relics of former
days. Among these are the saddle-cloth on which “good Queen Bess” sat
on her white charger at Tilbury Fort, and another saddle-cloth used by the
first Earl of Salisbury, the celebrated Sir Robert Cecil; a large collection of
arms, many of which were taken from the “invincible Armada” of the
Spaniards; and a number of models and other interesting objects. It contains
also several effigies of men in armour, one of which is given in our
initial letter.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Grand Staircase</span> is one of the most magnificent parts of this palatial
residence. It occupies, in plan, a space of 35 by 21 feet, and comprises
flights with five landings. “The balusters are massive, and carved in the
Italian form; above the handrail are represented genii, armorial lions, &amp;c.,
and here is a hatch-gate, probably to keep the favourite dogs from ascending
to the drawing-rooms. The upper division of the ceiling is enriched by a very
beautiful pendant in the Florentine style,” relieved by gold and silver and
colour. On the walls are hung a series of family portraits of the Cecils by
Lely, Kneller, Vandyke, Zucchero, Reynolds, and others. At the foot of
the staircase is the <span class="smcap">Dining-room</span>, panelled throughout with oak, and having an
enriched ceiling. Over the door is a marble bust of Lord Burleigh. Near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
this are the breakfast, summer, drawing, and other rooms, all of which are
fitted and furnished in a style of sumptuous magnificence, and contain a vast
number of very valuable paintings. Among the pictures contained in this
noble mansion are no fewer than five original portraits of Queen Elizabeth,
including the celebrated large one by Zucchero; and many portraits, &amp;c.,
which were the private property of that sovereign.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Gallery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Hall</span>, or <span class="smcap">Marble Hall</span>, is 50 feet by 30 feet, and is extremely
lofty. It is lit by an oriel window at the upper or daïs end, and by three bay
windows; and is panelled with oak and lined with fine old tapestry. A
carved screen, with an open gallery, decorated with armorial bearings, badges,
&amp;c., is at the east end, and the ceiling, which is coved and divided into compartments,
is decorated with the heads of the Cæsars. Here are deposited
two banners presented to the late marquis by the Duke of Wellington&mdash;part
of the “spoil” of Paris in 1814: here are also two other banners taken in the
Crimea.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Staircase leads, almost direct, to <span class="smcap">King James’s Room</span>, or the <span class="smcap">Great
Chamber</span>, one of the noblest apartments of the house, the extreme magnificence
of which it is not easy to describe; in truth, it is too rich, and the eye
turns involuntarily to the grand oriel windows for relief. The ceiling is of
exquisite design, and was till recently plain white; now it is all gold and
colours. The chimney-piece is massive, of white marble; and a central niche
over the fire contains a life-size statue of James I. in dark stone. The fire-dogs
are of silver; the furniture and the six chandeliers are gilt; the curtains
are of white satin; the chair and sofa coverings are crimson velvet; and the
carpet, “patent Axminster,” is of Elizabethan design, worked in brown, gold,
scarlet, and blue. This room, which is very large, contains some of the most
important pictures, including Reynolds’s portraits of George III. and Queen
Charlotte.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Gallery</span> extends the whole length of the south front; it is about
60 feet long and 20 feet wide. The ceiling is of remarkable beauty, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the finest examples of a period that was most prolific in such designs. The
walls are panelled with oak, and are profusely carved.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Library</span>, of equal dimensions with King James’s Room, is enriched
over the chimney-piece with a fine mosaic portrait of the first Earl of Salisbury&mdash;1608.
The collection of books and MSS. is of extreme interest and value.
Here, among other treasures, are preserved “the forty-two articles of
Edward VI., with his autograph;” Cardinal Wolsey’s instructions to the
ambassador sent to the Pope by Henry VIII., with Wolsey’s autograph; and
a pedigree of Queen Elizabeth, emblazoned, tracing her ancestry to Adam.
The state papers in the collection extend through the successive administrations
of Lord Burleigh and his son, the first Earl of Salisbury, and include
documents which came into Lord Burleigh’s hands through his connection
with the court. Here are no fewer than 13,000 letters, from the reign of
Henry VIII. to that of James I. Among the earlier MSS. are copies of
William of Malmesbury’s and Roger de Hoveden’s English History; a
splendid MS., with miniature of Henry VII.; another, with the autograph of
Henry VI.; a treatise on Councils, by Archbishop Cranmer; the original
depositions touching the divorce of Anne of Cleves; the proclamation of
Edward VI. on ascending the throne; the original council-book of Queen
Mary I.; historical MSS. by Lord Burleigh; the Duke of Norfolk’s book
of copies of his letters on the affairs of Mary Queen of Scots; accounts of the
Earl of Northumberland’s conspiracies, and the actual draft, in the handwriting
of Sir Robert Cecil, of the proclamation declaring James of Scotland
King of England, as well as the papers relating to the gunpowder plot, and to
the Raleigh conspiracy, &amp;c. Here are also many autograph letters of Queen
Elizabeth, and the famous Cecil papers, “the oak cradle of Queen Elizabeth,
the pair of silk stockings presented to her by Sir Thomas Gresham, and the
purse of James I.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chapel</span> is a remarkably fine and interesting room, with a richly-painted
window, and a gallery decorated with paintings of scriptural subjects.</p>

<p>The Park and grounds are full of fine trees, which from many points offer
beautiful pictures, more particularly when seen in combination with the house
or garden-terraces. Among the grand old trees in the park are the “Lion
Oak,” nearly 60 feet in girth, and a thousand years old; and “Queen Elizabeth’s
Oak,” under which she is said to have been sitting when she received
the news of her accession to the throne. The Gardens and Vineyard are
remarkably beautiful and interesting. The latter, which is entered through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
an avenue of yew trees forming a picturesque wall on either side, and cut so
as to give the appearance of walls and towers, with loopholes and battlements,
is immortalised by Pepys.</p>

<p>The Privy Garden, on the west side of the mansion, is enclosed within
a high and closely-cut hedge, with a close walk or avenue all around it. In
each of the four angles stood a mulberry tree, said to have been planted by
King James I., and in the centre is a pond surrounded by rock-work.</p>

<p>The three pairs of splendid entrance-gates, of French metal work, and
of the most elaborate and artistic character, were put up by the late Marquis
of Salisbury in 1846, when Hatfield House was honoured by the presence
of her Majesty and the Prince Consort.</p>

<p>The town of Hatfield presents few objects of antiquity; it stands on the
side of a hill, on the height of which are the gates of the mansion. Close
at hand is the parish church, a structure with little pretence to architectural
beauty.</p>

<p>We may not omit to mention that at the termination of the grounds runs
the clear and beautiful river Lee&mdash;here of considerable depth. There is no
bridge to cross to the other side, where are the kitchen gardens of the house,
but a ferry-boat is always at hand.</p>

<p>On a steep above the river is the yew-tree walk&mdash;a series of pathways
bordered by the venerable trees, dwarfed generally, but producing a most
agreeable effect.</p>

<p>In all respects, therefore, Hatfield House is largely gifted by Nature as
well as Art.</p>

spelt, lies about a mile distant from
Watford, in Hertfordshire. It is, therefore,
within easy distance&mdash;sixteen miles&mdash;from
London, and may be considered as one of
the breathing places of denizens of the Metropolis.
The name of Cassiobury is said, and with
reason to be derived from the Casii, a tribe of the
Britons who occupied the district, and whose stronghold,
Verulamium, lies only a few miles away. The
Casii were, at the time of the landing of Julius Cæsar,
commanded by Cassivelanus, under whom they fought
many battles with the invaders. The hundred is
still called the hundred of Cassio, and the affix of
<i>bury</i> evidently signifies an assemblage of dwellings
surrounded by walls, or a burgh or borough. “Being
as its name implies, the only <i>bury</i> within the manor
of Cassio during the Saxon era, it might have been
either the seat of justice for the hundred (for the
name <i>bury</i> will admit of this construction), or an occasional retreat of some
of the British princes residing at Verulamium, of whom Cassivelanus was
one,” and by some writers it is stated to have been “the actual seat or home
of Cassivelanus.”</p>

<p>Under the Saxons the manor of Cassio was, it has been stated, among the
numerous possessions of Offa with which he endowed the Abbey of St. Albans,
and it remained attached to that abbey until the dissolution of the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
houses by Henry VIII. In Domesday Book it is stated that “the Abbot of
St. Albans holds Cassiou; it answers for twenty hides; of these the abbot
holds nineteen. There is land for twenty-two ploughs. Six hides are in
demesne, and there are five ploughs, and a sixth may yet be made. Three
foreigners and thirty-six villeins with eight bordars have there fifteen ploughs,
and one may yet be made. There are, moreover, three bordars and two
bondmen, and four mills of 26<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> Meadow for twenty-two ploughs.
Pasture for the cattle. Pannage for 1,000 hogs. Its whole value is £28;
when received £24; and in King Edward’s time £30. St. Alban held and
holds this manor in demesne.” In the twelfth century the revenue duties
payable from Cassio to the abbey were, at Christmas 2<i>s.</i> and twenty-four
hens; at Easter, 2<i>s.</i> and 600 eggs; and on St. Alban’s day, 2<i>s.</i> and twenty-four
cheeses. By Henry I. the whole liberty of Cassio was formally made
over to the abbey. In 1546, after the dissolution of the monasteries, “the
lordship or manor of Cayshobury” and other places was granted to Sir
Richard Morrison, Knight, in consideration of certain property in Yorkshire
and Worcestershire, and of the sum of £176 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> in money; to hold the
same by the service of the tenth part of a knight, and paying for the same
yearly £5 12<i>s.</i> 6½<i>d.</i> Soon after this, Sir Richard commenced the erection
of “a fayre and large house, situated upon a dry hill not far from a pleasant
river in a fayre park, and had prepared materials for the finishing thereof; but
before the same could be half built, he was forced to fly beyond the seas.”
The mansion was completed by his son, Sir Charles Morrison, who died in
1599. On the marriage of Elizabeth Morrison, the only surviving child of
Sir Richard’s grandson, the property passed to her husband, Arthur Capel,
created Baron Capel of Hadham in 1641, from whom the present possessor,
the Earl of Essex, is lineally descended. Baron Capel appears to have resided
more at Hadham than at Cassiobury, but his son, Arthur Capel, created Viscount
Malden and Earl of Essex in 1661, after residing there for a time, took
up his residence at Cassiobury, the greater part of which he is said to have
rebuilt&mdash;indeed, it is said that the whole of the mansion, with the exception of
the north-west wing, was rebuilt by him, employing for the house May, the
architect, and for the laying out of his gardens Moses Cooke&mdash;who in 1675
published a volume on fruit-trees&mdash;and, it is also said, Le Notre, and Rose,
his head-gardener at Essex House, in the Strand.</p>

<p>Of the house and its
gardens, Evelyn, on the 16th April, 1680, thus wrote:&mdash;“On the earnest
invitation of the Earl of Essex, I went with him to his house at Cassioberie
in Hartfordshire. It was on Sunday, but going early from his house in the
square of St. James’s, we arrived by ten o’clock; this we thought too late to
go to church, and we had prayers in his chapell. The house is new, a plaine
fabric built by my friend Mr. Hugh May. There are divers faire and good
roomes, and excellent carving by Gibbons, especially the chimney-piece of ye
library. There is in the porch or entrance a painting by Verrio, of ‘Apollo
and the Liberal Arts.’ One room parquetted with yew which I lik’d well.
Some of the chimney-mantles are of Irish marble, brought by my lord from
Ireland, when he was Lord-Lieutenant, and not much inferior to Italian. The
tympanum or gable at the front is a <i>basso-relievo</i> of Diana hunting, cut in
Portland stone handsomely enough. I did not approve of the middle dores
being round, but when the Hall is finished as design’d, it being an oval with a
cupola, together with the other wing, it will be a very noble palace. The
library is large, and very nobly finished, and all the books are richly bound
and gilded; but there are no MSS. except the parliament rolls and journals,
the transcribing and binding of which cost him, as he assured me, £500. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
man has been more industrious than this noble lord in planting about his seat,
adorned with walkes, ponds, and other rural elegancies; but the soile is
stonie, churlish, and uneven, nor is the water neere enough to the house,
though a very swift and cleare streame run within a flight shot from it in the
valley, which may be fitly call’d Coldbrook, it being indeed excessive cold,
yet producing fair troutes. ‘Tis pitty the house was not situated to more
advantage, but it seems it was built just where the old one was, which,
I believe, he onlley meant to repaire; this leads men into irremediable errors,
and saves but a little. The land about it is exceedingly addicted to wood,
but the coldnesse of the place hinders the growth. Black cherry-trees prosper
even to considerable timber, some being 80 foote long; they make alsoe very
handsome avenues. There is a pretty oval at the end of a faire walke, set
about with treble rows of Spanish chesnut-trees. The gardens are very rare,
and cannot be otherwise, having so skilful an artist to govern them as Mr.
Cooke, who is, as to ye mechanick part, not ignorant in mathematiks, and
portends to astrologie. There is an excellent collection of the choicest fruit.”</p>

<p>By the second Earl of Essex the gardens were altered and improved; and
it is said that those of the old mansion of the Morrisons which had not been
reconstructed by the first earl, were restored or rebuilt by him. With the
exception of these alterations and a few other occasional repairs, the house
remained as it was left by the first Earl of Essex, until the beginning of the
nineteenth century, when the greater part was again rebuilt by the late earl,
from the designs of James Wyatt.</p>

<p>We now proceed to speak of the families of Morrison and Capel, to whom
Cassiobury has successively belonged.</p>

<p>William Morrison, or Morysine, in the reign of Henry VI. resided at
Chardwell, Yorkshire, and it was his grandson, Thomas Morrison, of Chardwell,
son of William Morrison by a daughter of Roger Leigh, of Preston, who
removed into Hertfordshire. He married a daughter of Thomas Merry, of
Hatfield, by whom he had a son, Sir Richard Morrison, who, in 1537,
succeeded Cardinal Pole in the prebend of Yatsminster-Seconda in Salisbury
Cathedral. In 1539 he was appointed by Henry VIII. ambassador to
Charles V., Emperor of Germany, in which he was accompanied by Roger
Ascham, and, in 1546, had a grant of the manor of Cashiobury, and soon
after commenced building there a mansion of considerable size. Besides
Cashiobury he had grants, and acquired much property, in London, Wiltshire,
Hampshire, and Somersetshire. Under Queen Mary and her persecutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Sir Richard was compelled to fly from England, and died at Strasburg in
1556. He married Bridget Hussey, daughter of Lord Hussey (who, after his
death, married successively Henry, second Earl of Rutland, and Francis, third
Earl of Bedford), by whom he had issue one son, Sir Charles Morrison, Knight,
and three daughters, Elizabeth, married first to Henry Norris, son of Lord
Norris, of Rycote, and secondly to Henry, second Earl of Lincoln; Mary,
married to Bartholomew Hales, of Chesterfield; and Jane Sibilla, married,
first to Edward, Lord Russell, and, second, to Arthur, Lord Grey, of Wilton.
Sir Charles Morrison, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, and was a minor
at the time of his father’s death, married Dorothy, daughter of Nicholas
Clarke, and widow of Henry Long, of Shengie, and by her had issue a son,
Sir Charles Morrison, and three daughters, Bridgett, married to Robert, fifth
Earl of Sussex, and Elizabeth and Catherine, who died unmarried. This second
Sir Charles, who succeeded his father in 1599, and was then a minor, was
created a baronet by letters patent, June 29, 1611, and on the coronation of
Charles I. was installed a Knight of the Bath. He married Mary, daughter
and co-heiress of Baptist, Lord Hicks and Viscount Campden (the lady afterwards
married successively Sir John Cooper, Bart., and Sir Richard Alford,
Knight), and by her had issue two sons, who died young, and a daughter,
Elizabeth Morrison, who thus became his only heir. This lady, Elizabeth
Morrison, married Arthur Capel, who, by letters patent, dated August 6, 1641,
was created Baron Capel, of Hadham, and thus the large estates of the
Morrisons, both at Cashiobury and elsewhere, passed into the family of Capel,
its present holders. The arms of Morrison were, <i>or</i>, on a chief, <i>gules</i>, three
chaplets of the first. Crest, specially conferred on Sir Richard, in allusion to
his literary attainments, a Pegasus rising, <i>or</i>.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>From the Wood Walks.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The noble family of Capel to whom Cassiobury, as has been stated, passed
by marriage with the heiress of Morrison, and to whom it still belongs, is of
considerable antiquity, and few families have been enriched by so many
scions of brilliant intellect. The family appears to have been originally of
Capel’s Moan, hear Stoke Neyland, in Suffolk, and here, in 1261, resided Sir
Richard de Capel, Lord Justice of Ireland: in 1368, Lionel, Duke of Clarence,
son of Edward III., left by will “to John de Capell, my chaplain, a girdle of
gold, to make a chalice in memory of my soul.” Later on another John
Capel, who died in 1441, left, by his wife, Joan, besides a son, John, a
second son, William Capel, who was a draper and citizen of London, “and
successively alderman, sheriff, representative of the city in Parliament, and
lord mayor, and had the honour of knighthood conferred on him by
Henry VII.” He was twice lord mayor, and several times M.P. of the
city. He died in 1515, and “was buried in a chapel founded by himself on
the south side of the church of St. Bartholomew, near the Royal Exchange,
London.” He also gave his name to Capel Court. He married Margaret,
daughter of Sir Thomas Arundell, of Lanhorne, by whom, besides two
daughters, he had a son, Sir Giles Capel, Knight, who succeeded him, and
married, first, Mary, daughter of Richard Roos, son of Lord Roos, and,
secondly, Isabel, daughter of Sir Thomas Newton, by whom he had issue a
daughter, and two sons, Sir Henry and Sir Edward. Sir Henry Capel
married Anne, daughter of Lord Roos, and granddaughter of the Duchess of
Exeter, sister to King Edward IV.: he died without surviving issue, and was
succeeded by his brother, Sir Edward Capel, whose wife was Anne, daughter
of Sir William Pelham, ancestor of the Dukes of Newcastle; he, dying in
1577, was succeeded by his eldest son. Sir Henry Capel, Knight, who, by his
second wife, Catherine, daughter of Thomas, Earl of Rutland, had, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
several others, a son, Sir Arthur Capel, Knight, who succeeded him, and was
in turn succeeded by his son, Sir Henry Capel. This gentleman, who, like
many of his family, had been Sheriff of Herts, married twice. By his first
wife, Theodosia, daughter of Sir Edward Montagne, he had issue, besides
others, a son, Arthur Capel, who was a minor at the time of his death.</p>

<p>Arthur Capel was born about the year 1614, and, both his parents dying
when he was young, he was brought up by his grandfather, Sir Arthur. He
espoused the royal cause in the troublous times of Charles I., and became one
of his most valued and zealous adherents. He was rewarded with a peerage,
being created Baron Capel of Hadham, the king in desiring this reward having
written to the Queen, “there is one that doth not yet pretend, that deserves
as well as any; I mean Capel; therefore I desire thy assistance to find out
something for him before he ask.” After taking an active part in support and
defence of the king, Lord Capel was imprisoned in the Tower, and on the 9th
of March, 1649, he was beheaded before the great gate of Westminster Hall.
“His body was buried at Little Hadham, with an inscription stating him to
have been murdered for his loyalty to King Charles I.; and his heart, according
to a wish he had expressed to Bishop Morley, was enclosed in a silver cup
and cover, to be eventually buried at the feet of the master whom he had so
zealously served. But no funeral rites being performed to the memory of
Charles I., the cup was kept in a press at Hadham, where it was discovered
in 1703, and its contents placed in the family vault.” It was this Lord Capel
who, before his elevation to the peerage, had married Elizabeth Morrison, and
so acquired Cassiobury and the rest of the large possessions of the Morrison
family. The issue of this marriage was four sons and four daughters, viz.,
Arthur, who succeeded his father; Sir Henry Capel, created Baron Capel of
Tewkesbury; Charles and Edward, who died unmarried; Mary, married,
first, to Lord Beauchamp, and, secondly, to Henry, Duke of Beaufort;
Elizabeth, married to the Earl of Carnarvon; Theodosia, wife of the Earl of
Clarendon; and Anne, of John Strangeways.</p>

<p>Arthur, second Baron Capel, was, in 1601, created Viscount Maiden and
Earl of Essex, and in 1670 was appointed ambassador to the court of Denmark.
He it was who, as has already been stated, rebuilt Cassiobury, and
formed its beautiful gardens. In 1683 his lordship was apprehended at
Cassiobury on a charge of being concerned in the famous “Rye House Plot,”
and was committed to the Tower, where he was, as is believed, foully murdered,
or at all events, where he was found dead with his throat cut. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
earl married Elizabeth, only daughter of Algernon Percy, Earl of Northumberland,
by whom he had six sons and two daughters, most of whom dying
young, he was at his death succeeded by his fifth son, Algernon Capel.</p>

<p>Algernon, second Earl of Essex, was Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to
King William III., and held important offices under Queen Anne. He married
Mary, daughter of the Earl of Portland, by whom he had issue two daughters
and one son, William Capel, who succeeded him as third Earl of Essex. This
Earl married twice, and had, by his first wife, Jane, daughter of the Earl of
Clarendon, four daughters; and by his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of
the Duke of Bedford, four daughters, and one son, by whom he was succeeded.
This was&mdash;</p>

<p>William Anne Holles Capel, fourth Earl of Essex, one of the Lords of the
Bed-chamber to George II. and George III., and Lord-Lieutenant of Hertfordshire.
He married Frances, daughter of Sir Charles Hanbury Williams,
Bart., by whom he acquired the estate of Hampton Court, Herefordshire,
which was afterwards sold to Richard Arkwright, Esq., of Cromford, Derbyshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and by her had issue two daughters, and a son, George Capel, who
succeeded him, in 1759, as fifth Earl of Essex; and, secondly, Harriet,
daughter of Colonel Thomas Bladen, by whom he had issue five sons, viz.,
one who died young; John Thomas, whose son succeeded to the title and
estates as sixth Earl of Essex; Lieut.-General Thomas Edward Capel; Hon.
and Rev. William Robert Capel, chaplain to the King; and Rear-Admiral the
Hon. Bladen Thomas Capel. His lordship died in 1799, and was succeeded
by his son, George Capel, who, having succeeded to the estates of his
maternal grandmother, assumed the name of Coningsby, and became George
Capel-Coningsby, fifth Earl of Essex, Viscount Malden, and sixth Baron
Capel. His lordship married twice, first, in 1786, Sarah, daughter of Henry
Bazett, Esq., of St. Helena, and widow of Edward Stephenson, Esq.; and
secondly, in 1838, Catherine, daughter of Mr. E. Stephens, but had no issue
by either marriage. His lordship died in 1839, and was succeeded in his title
and estates by his nephew, Arthur Algernon Capel, the son of his half-brother,
the Hon. John Thomas Capel.</p>

<p>Arthur Algernon Capel, sixth Earl of Essex and Viscount Malden, and
seventh Baron Capel of Hadham, was born January 28th, 1803. In 1825 he
married the Lady Caroline Jeanetta Beauclerk, third daughter of the eighth
Duke of St. Albans, and by her, who died in 1862, had issue: Arthur De Vere
Capel, Viscount Malden, born 1826 (heir to the title and estate, who married,
in 1853, Emma Martha, daughter of Sir Henry Meux, Bart., and has issue),
the Hon. Adela Caroline Harriet Capel, now deceased, married to the Earl of
Eglintoun; the Hon. Reginald Algernon Capel, married to Mary, daughter of
John Nicholas Fazkerly, Esq., and niece of the Earl of Rokeby; and the
Hon. Randolph Capel. In 1863, his lordship married, secondly, the Lady
Louisa Caroline Elizabeth Boyle, daughter of Viscountess Dungarvon, and
sister to the Earl of Cork, and by her has issue living, the Hon. Arthur
Algernon Capel, born 1864, and the Hon. Beatrice Mary, born 1870. His
lordship is patron of the livings of Watford, in Hertfordshire, Rayne, in
Essex, and Shuttington, in Warwickshire.</p>

<p>The arms of the Earl of Essex are&mdash;<i>Gules</i>, a lion rampant between three
cross-crosslets fitchée, <i>or</i>; crest, a demi-lion rampant supporting a cross-crosslet
fitchée, <i>or</i>; supporters, two lions, <i>or</i>, ducally crowned, <i>gules</i>; motto,
“Fide et Fortitudine.”</p>

<p>The park of Cassiobury embraces an area of nearly seven hundred acres,
of which more than three hundred and fifty are called “the Home Park,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>”
and about two hundred and fifty the “Upper Park;” they are separated
from each other by the river Gade, which flows between them. The
remainder of the ground is divided into woods, lawns, gardens, and all the
other elegancies of grounds around the house, the site of which is also
included in it. The parks are well wooded with majestic trees, among which
are a profusion of beech, oak, elm, and fir&mdash;some of the latter resembling in
their enormous size those of Norway. Several of the beech-trees, too, are of
gigantic size, some being said to cover an area of ground nearly 150 feet in
diameter.</p>

<p>The present mansion was built from the designs of Mr. James Wyatt, at
that time the fashionable architect of Fonthill Abbey, of parts of Windsor
Castle, and other places: it is of that peculiar style of Gothic architecture
which characterizes most buildings erected by him. The general plan is a
square; the building surrounding a court-yard or quadrangle, with a cloister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
on two of its sides; the entrance being to the west, the chief room to the
south, the private or family rooms to the east, and the kitchen, servants’
offices, &amp;c., to the north. A porch screens the entrance-doorway, that opens
into a narrow cloister, on the right of which is a small vestibule and enclosed
staircase. Eastward of these is the great cloister, having five windows,
partly of stained glass, and its walls adorned with full-length family portraits
and other paintings.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Lodge.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Branching off from the cloisters is the <span class="smcap">Saloon</span>, placed between the dining
and drawing-rooms. “Its ceiling is adorned with the painting Evelyn mentions
as belonging to the hall of the old mansion, and to have been the work
of Verrio, the subject being composed chiefly of allegorical figures&mdash;Painting,
Sculpture, Music, and War. In this apartment are two cabinets, containing
numerous miniatures painted by the Countess of Essex,” and many family and
other portraits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Dining-Room</span>, which is a noble apartment, with wainscoted walls,
also hang several remarkably fine family and other portraits, by Vandyke,
Hoppner, and other painters; and several fine pictures,&mdash;notably, “The Cat’s
Paw,” by Landseer, and “The Highlander’s Home,” by Wilkie.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Grand Drawing-Room</span>, which is filled with all the elegancies and
luxuries of the most refined taste, and with the choicest cabinets, is adorned
with paintings by Turner, Callcott, Collins, and others. These are of the
highest order&mdash;rare and beautiful examples of the great English masters in
art. Adjoining the drawing-room is the conservatory cloister, which is
entered both from it and from the library.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Library</span>, which occupies four rooms,&mdash;respectively known as the
Great Library, the Inner Library, the Dramatists’ Library, and the Small
Library,&mdash;is remarkably extensive; and contains, as such a library ought, a
rare collection of valuable books in every class of literature. In these various
rooms is preserved a fine collection of family paintings; and here, too, will
be seen some of Grinling Gibbon’s matchless carvings, which are noticed
by Evelyn as being there in his day. Among the historical relics preserved
in the Library is the handkerchief which Lord Coningsby applied to the
shoulder of King William III., when that monarch was wounded, in 1690, at
the battle of the Boyne. It is stained with the blood of the king. There is
also here a piece of the velvet pall of Charles I., taken from the tomb at
Windsor, when it was opened in 1813, with a fragment of the Garter worn by
the king at his execution.</p>

<p>Like these, the other apartments at Cassiobury are filled with choice
paintings and with everything that good taste and a lavish hand can suggest.
The family portraits are, as might be expected, numerous, and of the highest
order of art, several are by Vandyke, Cornelius Jansen, Sir Peter Lely, Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and other famous artists. Throughout the rooms are
scattered admirable works by Rembrandt, Cuyp, Teniers, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>We have made but brief reference to the gardens and grounds, and
scarcely noticed the spacious and very beautiful Park. They are charms that
neither lofty descent nor large wealth could purchase&mdash;the bequests only of
Time. Centuries have passed since some of these magnificent trees were
planted. The house is best seen from one of the high steeps on the opposite
side of the river that runs through the demesne; lines of venerable chestnuts
border a greensward that extends miles.</p>

<p>Here and there glimpses are caught of the mansion, made by distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
more picturesque than it is at a nearer range. In fact, there is at Cassiobury
the happy combination of grandeur and beauty, natural grace in association
with rich cultivation, that makes so many of the Stately Homes of England
the boast and glory of the country.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>In the Church at Watford.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The family burial-place of the Morrison and Capel families of Cassiobury
is at Watford, where a fine monumental chapel exists in the parish church.
This chapel “contains sepulchral memorials to the Morrison and Capel
families, from that of Lady Morrison, wife of Sir Richard Morrison, who
directed the chapel to be built in 1595.” In the centre is an altar-tomb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
supported upon six pillars, of various coloured marbles, on which rests the
recumbent figure of “Lady Bridget, Countess of Bedford”&mdash;the lady by
whom the chapel was founded&mdash;and daughter of Lord Hussey. She died
in 1600.</p>

<p>On the south side “is a large and gorgeous monument to Sir Charles
Morrison the elder, whose effigy, in armour, in a reclining posture, is placed
under the canopy.” On either side of the tomb, in kneeling positions upon
pedestals, are figures of the son and daughter of Sir Charles Morrison, and
Bridget Morrison, Countess of Sussex. This work was executed by Nicholas
Stone, in 1619, who agreed with Sir Charles to make “a tomb of alabaster
and touchstone,” and whose entry in his note-book as to price is very curious.
He says he made it with “one pictor of white marble for his father, and his
own, and his sister, the Countess of Sesex, as great as the life, of alabaster,
for the which I had well payed £260, and four pieces given to drinke.”</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the chapel is another large monument to the second
Sir Charles Morrison, designed and executed by the same “carver and tomb-maker,”
as he is termed in the contract, and for which he agreed with the
widow to receive £400. There are also several other interesting monuments
and monumental slabs; the chapel is hung with banners and hatchments.</p>

<p>At this time, the church is undergoing thorough repair and restoration.</p>

<p class="dc19">CHATSWORTH, the “Palace of the Peak,” perhaps
more than any other house in England, merits
its proud distinction as a “<span class="smcap">Stately Home</span>.”
Situated in the most beautiful district of Derbyshire;
possessing many natural advantages
within the circuit of its domain&mdash;of hill and
valley, wood and water, rugged rock and verdant
plain, and rendered attractive by every means
the most poetic imagination could conceive and
unbounded wealth accomplish, it is foremost
among the finest and most charming seats in
the kingdom; where the delights of natural
beauty, aided by Art, may be fully and freely
enjoyed by all comers. Belonging to his Grace
the Duke of Devonshire&mdash;one of the most
enlightened and liberal-minded of our English
aristocracy&mdash;Chatsworth, with its park and
grounds, is thrown open to “the people,”
under such restrictions only as are essentially necessary to
its well-being and proper conservation. Assuredly no
mansion and grounds are more freely and liberally made
available to the public, while none are more worthy of being
visited. It will be our task, therefore, to endeavour to
describe several of its beauties and attractions, and to unfold and spread out
before our readers some of the rich treasures of Nature and of Art it contains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>And, first, a few words on its geographical position and history.</p>

<p>Chatsworth lies in the parish of Edensor, in the hundred of High Peak, in
the county of Derby. It is three miles from the Midland Railway Station at
Rowsley (of which we have spoken in our account of Haddon Hall, and which
is the most convenient station for visitors from the south), three-and-a-half
miles from Bakewell (where there is a station convenient for visitors from the
north) two from Baslow, twenty-six from Derby, ten from Matlock Bath, nine
from Chesterfield, twelve from Sheffield, fourteen from Buxton, thirty-seven
from Manchester, and about one hundred and fifty-four from London. The
railway stations from which Chatsworth is best reached are, as just stated,
Rowsley and Bakewell; the line from London and the south to the former
passing through Derby, Duffield, Belper, Ambergate (where the lines from
Sheffield, Leeds, York, and the north join in), Whatstandwell, Cromford, Matlock
Bath, Matlock Bridge, and Darley Dale; and to the latter from Manchester
and Buxton, passing Miller’s Dale, Monsal Dale, Longstone, and Hassop.</p>

<p>At the time of the Domesday Survey of William the Conqueror, Chatsworth
belonged to the Crown, and was held by William Peverel, the entry
being as follows: “In Langlie and Chetesuorde, Leuenot and Chetel had ten
ox-gangs of land for geld [land for ten oxen]. This belonged to Ednesoure.
William Pevrel keeps them for the king. Five villanes and two bordars have
two ploughs and one acre of meadow there. Wood, pasturable, one mile in
length and one in breadth, and a little underwood. In the time of King
Edward it was worth twenty shillings; now, sixteen shillings.” The name
of <i>Chetesuorde</i>, now altered into Chatsworth, was doubtless originally <i>Chetelsuorde</i>,
from the name of one of its Saxon owners, Chetel. After the Peverels,
the manor of Chatsworth was held by the family of Leche, who had long been
settled there before they became possessed of the manor, and who held it for
several generations. In the reign of Edward III. one member of this family,
John Leche, of Chatsworth, whose father is said to have been of Carden (a
line continued by a younger son), was one of the surgeons to the king. In
the reign of Henry IV. Sir Roger Leche, knight, held, among other property,
lands at Glossop. They also held, among others, the manors of Totley.
Shipley, Willersley, Cromford, and the prebendal manor of Sawley. John
Leche, surgeon to Edward III., was, it appears, grantee of Castle Warin and
other lands, and had a son, Daniel Leche, whose son, John Leche, married
Lucy de Cawarden, and thus became possessed of the manor of Carden. The
family of Leche of Chatsworth became extinct in the reign of Edward VI., by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the death of Francis Leche, who had, however, previously sold this manor to
the Agards. One of the co-heiresses of Ralph Leche, of Chatsworth, uncle to
Francis, married Thomas Kniveton, of Mercaston, father of Sir William and
grandfather of Sir Gilbert Kniveton; another married a Wingfield, and the
third espoused Slater, of Sutton, in the county of Lincoln. Francis Leche,
to whom we have referred, married Alice, daughter of John Hardwick, of
Hardwick, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of John Leake, of Hasland, a
branch of the Leakes, Earls of Scarsdale. This Alice, on the death of her
only brother, John Hardwick, without issue, became one of his co-heiresses,
with her three sisters&mdash;Mary, who married, first, Wingfield, and, second,
Pollard, of Devonshire; Jane, married to Godfrey Bosville, of Gunthwaite;
and Elizabeth, better known as “Bess of Hardwick,” who married, first,
Robert Barley, of Barley&mdash;second, Sir William Cavendish&mdash;third, Sir William
St. Loe&mdash;and fourth, Gilbert, fourth Earl of Shrewsbury. This Francis
Leche, as has just been stated, sold the manor and estates of Chatsworth to
Agard, who shortly afterwards resold it to Sir William Cavendish, the husband
of “Bess of Hardwick,” and, consequently, the brother-in-law of Alice Leche.</p>

<p>The family of Agard is of very ancient origin in the county of Derby,
being settled at Foston as early as 1310. In the reign of Charles II. the
Foston estate was sold by John Agard, and about the same time, one of the
co-heiresses of Charles Agard, the last heir-male of the main line, married
John Stanhope, of Elvaston, the ancestor of the Earls of Harrington. Another
branch of the Agards settled at Sudbury, in the same county, and one of them
married the heiress of Ferrars, of Tamworth. The Agards, as feodaries or
bailiffs of the honour of Tutbury, were possessed of a horn (described in the
“Archæologia”) which passed, with the office, to Charles Stanhope, Esq., of
Elvaston, on his marriage with the heiress. Arthur Agard, born at Foston,
in 1540, was an able and eminent antiquary, and was one of the members
of the first Society of Antiquaries. His essays read to the Society occur in
Hearne’s “Discourses,” and a treatise by him on the obscure words in
Domesday-book, are, with other papers, in the Cottonian Collection in the
British Museum. He held office as Deputy-Chamberlain of the Exchequer,
and died in 1615. A John Agard founded a chantry at Lupton.</p>

<p>Shortly after acquiring Chatsworth by purchase from the Agards, Sir
William Cavendish pulled down the old Hall of the Leches, and began the
erection of the mansion which, in a few years after its construction, was
destined to become a place of historical interest. Sir William Cavendish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
it appears, died before his plans for building had been carried out to any
great extent; and its completion, on a much larger scale than he had intended,
was left to his widow (who ultimately became Countess of Shrewsbury), by
whom Hardwick Hall and other places were erected; and of whom it was
said that, having a firm belief she should never die so long as she continued
building, kept on year after year; until at last, a terrible frost coming on, the
masons were thrown out of work, when she languished and died. The
mansion, commenced by Sir William Cavendish, and completed by his widow,
was a quadrangular building, the west front of which had a square tower at
each end, and the entrance, in the centre, was between four angular towers.
Of this front of the building a representation is happily preserved at Chatsworth,
which, through the kindness and courtesy of its noble owner, the
present Duke of Devonshire, we are enabled to engrave.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Old Hall as it formerly stood.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It was in this mansion that that truly unhappy sovereign, Mary, Queen
of Scots, was kept so long a prisoner under the care of the Earl of Shrewsbury&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
suite of rooms occupied by her being on the upper, or state-room
story, of the east side of the quadrangle, and immediately opposite to the then
principal entrance. The unfortunate queen was first brought captive to
Chatsworth in May or June, 1570, from Tutbury Castle, probably spending a
short time on her way at another of the earl’s residences, Wingfield Manor:
here she remained for some months, and here, it is pleasant to know, the
severity of her confinement was in some degree relaxed; yet the surveillance
kept over her by the Earl of Shrewsbury was enough to disappoint a scheme
laid for her release by two sons of the Earl of Derby, and a Derbyshire
gentleman named Hall. At this time the Queen of Scots’ establishment consisted
of thirty persons, among whom was John Beton, a member of the same
family to which Cardinal Beton belonged. This faithful servant, who was her
“prægustator”&mdash;an office in royal households of which frequent mention is
made in the old writers of the Middle Ages&mdash;died while Mary was in captivity
at Chatsworth, and was buried in the church of Edensor, close by, where a
monument, which yet remains, was erected by his attached mistress. Of this
monument we shall give an engraving later on. During this same year at
Chatsworth it was that the series of personal negotiations which kept hope
alive in the breast of the fair captive was commenced, and in which Cecil and
Mildmay, who were at Chatsworth in October, took part. At this time the
project of removing her to Sheffield was mooted, and on his return to court
from Chatsworth, Cecil wrote his memorable letter, allowing her a little horse-exercise
about the grounds of Chatsworth.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Now for the removing of yt quene, hir Maty said at the first that she trusted so to
make an end in short tyme yt your L. shuld be shortly ac’qted of hir; nevertheless when
I told her Maty that yow cold not long indure your howshold there for lack of fewell and
other thyngs, and yt I thought Tutbury not so fitt a place as it was supposed, but yt
Sheffield was ye metest, hir Maty sayd she wold thynk of it, and wtin few dayes gyve me
knolledg: Only I see her Maty loth to have yt Q. to be often removed, supposying that
therby she cometh to new acqueyntance; but to that I sayd Yor L. cold remove hir wtout
callying any to you but your owne. Uponn motiō made by me, at the B. of Ross’s
request, the Q. Maty is pleased yt your L. shall, whan yow see tymes mete, suffer ye
Quene to take ye ayre about your howss on horssback, so your L. be in copany; and
therein I am sure your L. will have good respect to your owne company, to be suer and
trusty; and not to pass fro yowr howss above one or twoo myle, except it be on ye moores;
for I never feare any other practise of strangers as long as ther be no corruptiō amongst
your owne.”</p>

<p class="p1">This letter was followed by another, giving the irate queen’s promise to
remove Mary to Sheffield, whither she was taken a little before Christmas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
The orders for the government of the household of the captive queen after her
removal were so stringent and curious that they will, no doubt, be read with
interest. The original document is preserved in the Cottonian Library in the
British Museum. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“To the Mr of the Scotts Queene’s household, Mr Beton.</p>

<p>“First,&mdash;That all your people wch appertayneth to the Queen shall depart from the
Queen’s chamber or chambers to their own lodging at IX. of the clock at night, winter and
summer, whatsoever he or she; either to their lodging within the house or without in the
Towne, there to remain till the next day at VI. of the clock.</p>

<p>“Item,&mdash;That none of the Queen’s people shall at no time wear his sword neither
within the house, nor when her Grace rydeth or goeth abroade: unless the Master of the
Household himself to weare a sword, and no more without my special license.</p>

<p>“Item,&mdash;That there shall none of the Queen’s people carry any bow or shaftes, at no
tyme, neither to the field nor to the butts, unless it be foure or fyve, and no more, being in
the Queen’s companye.</p>

<p>“Item,&mdash;That none of the Queen’s people shall ryde or go at no tyme abroad out of the
House or towne without my special license: and if he or they so doth, they or he shall
come no more in at the gates, neither in the towne, whatsoever he or she or they be.</p>

<p>“Item,&mdash;That youe or some of the Queen’s chamber, when her Grace will walke
abroad, shall advertyse the officiar of my warde who shall declare the messuage to me one
houer before she goeth forth.</p>

<p>“Item,&mdash;That none of the Queen’s people whatsoever he or they be, not once offer at
no tyme to come forth of their chamber or lodging when anie alarum is given by night or
daie, whether they be in the Queen’s chambers or in their chambers within the house, or
without in the towne. And yf he or they keepe not their chamber or lodgings whatsoever
that be, he or they shall stande at their perill for deathe.</p>

<p class="pr4">“At Shefeild, the 26th daie of April, 1571, per me,</p>

<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">Shrewsburie</span>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">These orders satisfied Elizabeth, for Cecil says:&mdash;“The Q. Ma<sub>ty</sub> lyketh
well of all your ordres.”</p>

<p>It will no doubt interest our readers to be put in possession of a list of her
attendants at this time. They were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi6q p1">“My Lady Leinstoun, dame of honour to the quene’s Ma<sup>te</sup>.<br />
M’rez Leinstoun.<br />
M’rez Setoun.<br />
Maistresse Brusse.<br />

Jhan de Boyes, pastilar.<br />
Mr. Brusse, gentilman to my Lord Leinstoun.<br />
Nicholl Fichar, servant to my Lady Leinstoun.<br />
Jhon Dumfrys, servant to Maistresse Setoun.<br />
William Blake, servant to Maistresse Courcelles, to serve in absence of Florence.”</p>

<p class="p1">Besides these the following supernumerary servants were kindly allowed
by the earl and approved by the queen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi6q p1">“Christilie Hog, Bastiene’s wyff.<br />
Ellen Bog, the Mr cooke’s wyff.<br />
Cristiane Grame, my Lady Leinstoun’s gentilwoman.<br />
Janet Lindesay, M’rez Setoun’s gentilwoman.<br />
Jannette Spetell.<br />
Robert Hamiltoun, to bere fyre and water to the quene’s cuysine.<br />
Robert Ladel, the quene’s lacquay.<br />
Gilbert Bonnar, horskeippar.<br />
Francoys, to serve M<sup>re</sup> Castel, the phesitien.”</p>

<p class="p1">The earl, to insure her safe-keeping, took to himself forty extra servants,
chosen from his tenantry, to keep watch day and night: so this must, indeed,
have been a busy and bustling, as well as an anxious time, at Chatsworth and
at Sheffield.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1578 Mary was once more at Chatsworth, but in
November was back again, as close a prisoner as ever at Sheffield. Again
in 1577 she was, for a short time, at Chatsworth, at which period the
Countess of Shrewsbury was still building there. It was in this year that the
countess wrote to her husband the letter endeavouring to get him to spend
the summer there, in which she uses the strange expressions, “Lette me here
how you, your charge <i>and love</i> dothe, and commende me I pray you.” In
1581 Mary was again brought to Chatsworth, and probably was there at other
times than those we have indicated. In any case, the fact of her being there
kept a captive, invests the place with a powerful interest of a far different kind
from any other it possesses. One solitary remain&mdash;“Mary Queen of Scots’
Bower”&mdash;of this ill-starred sovereign’s captivity at Chatsworth now exists; to
this reference will be made later on.</p>

<p>It is also essential here to note, that during these troublous times, the ill-fated
Lady Arabella Stuart&mdash;the child of Charles Stuart, Earl of Lennox, and
of his wife Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of Sir William Cavendish, by his
wife “Bess of Hardwick”&mdash;was born at Chatsworth. The beautiful, much-injured,
and ill-fated Lady Arabella, whose sole crime was that she was born
a Stuart, is thus in more ways than one, like her relative, Mary Queen of
Scots, not only mixed up with Chatsworth, but with the family of its noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
possessor. The incidents of the life of this young, beautiful, and accomplished
lady, which form one of the most touching episodes in our national
history&mdash;the jealous eye with which Elizabeth looked upon her from her birth&mdash;the
careful watch set over her by Cecil&mdash;the trials of Raleigh and his
friends&mdash;her troubles with her aunt (Mary, Countess of Shrewsbury)&mdash;her
being placed under restraint&mdash;her marriage with Seymour&mdash;her seizure, imprisonment,
sufferings, and death as a hopeless lunatic in the Tower of
London, where she had been thrown by her cousin, King James I., are all
matters of history, and invest her short, sad life with a melancholy interest.
One of the old ballads to which her misfortunes gave rise, thus alludes to her
connection with Derbyshire:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“My lands and livings, so well known,</p>
<p class="pp7">Unto your books of majesty,</p>
<p class="pp6">Amount to twelve-score pounds a week,</p>
<p class="pp7">Besides what I do give,” quoth she.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“In gallant Derbyshire likewise,</p>
<p class="pp7">I nine-score beadsmen maintain there,</p>
<p class="pp6">With hats and gowns and house-rent free,</p>
<p class="pp7">And every man five marks a year.”</p>

<p class="p1">During the civil wars the old hall of Chatsworth was taken possession of,
and garrisoned, in 1643, for the Parliament by Sir John Gell, being then
placed under the command of Captain Stafford, from whose company at Chatsworth
in the latter part of the year, forty musqueteers were ordered to be
drafted off, and joined to the army of Fairfax for his proposed march to
Chesterfield and the North. At the end of the same year the Earl of Newcastle’s
forces having taken Wingfield Manor, and other places in the county,
made themselves masters of Chatsworth (which had been evacuated on his
approach to Chesterfield), and garrisoned it for the king under Colonel Eyre,
who the following spring received reinforcements from Tissington and Bakewell.
In September, 1645, “the governor of Welbecke having gotten good
strength by the kinges coming that way, came to Derbyshire with 300 horse
and dragoones, to sett upp a garrison at Chatsworth, and one Colonel Shallcross,
for governor there. Colonel Gell having intelligence thereof, sent presently
Major Molanus with 400 foott to repossess the house; and having layn
theire 14 days, and hearing of the demolishinge of Welbecke, Bolsover, and
Tickhill castles, was commanded by Colonel Gell to return to Derby.”</p>

<p>A little before these troublous times, in 1636, Thomas Hobbes, best known
as “Leviathan Hobbes” or “Hobbes of Malmesbury,” who, before he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
twenty years of age, became tutor to the sons of Sir William Cavendish (then
recently created Baron Cavendish of Hardwick), and who lived and died in
the family, thus wrote of the beauty of Chatsworth, and of the nobleness of
soul of its owner, his patron and friend:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“On th’ English Alps, where Darbie’s Peak doth rise<br />
High up in Hills that emulate the skies,<br />
And largely waters all the Vales below<br />
With Rivers that still plentifully flow,<br />
Doth <span class="smcap">Chatsworth</span> by swift Derwin’s Channel stand,<br />
Fam’d for its pile, and Lord, for both are grand.<br />
Slowly the River by its Gates doth pass,<br />
Here silent, as in wonder of the place,<br />
But does from rocky precipices move<br />
In rapid streams below it; and above<br />
A lofty Mountain guards the house behind<br />
From the assaults of the rough eastern wind;<br />
Which does from far its rugged Cliffs display,<br />
And sleep prolongs by shutting out the day.<br />
Behind, a pleasant Garden does appear:<br />
Where the rich earth breathes odours everywhere;<br />
Where, in the midst of Woods, the fruitful tree<br />
Bears without prune-hook, seeming now as free;<br />
Where, by the thick-leav’d roof, the walls are made&mdash;<br />
Spite of the Sun where all his beams display’d&mdash;<br />
More cool than the fam’d Virgil’s beechen shade;<br />
Where Art (itself dissembling), rough-hewn stone<br />
And craggy flints worn out by dropping on<br />
(Together joyning by the workman’s tool),<br />
Makes horrid rocks and watry caverns cool.”</p>

<p class="p1">Of Hobbes we give an interesting and curious memoir in the present
volume, under the head of “Hardwick Hall.” Of the old house as it existed
in 1680-1, we have, fortunately, a very graphic word-picture, preserved to us
in Charles Cotton’s “Wonders of the Peak;” and an admirable pictorial
representation in one of Knyff’s careful drawings, engraved by Kipp, of the
same house, when the south front and other parts had been rebuilt, but the
west front with its towers was remaining entire. Cotton’s&mdash;friend and companion
of Izaak Walton&mdash;description of the place is so clever and so graphic
that it cannot fail to interest our readers. We can, however, find room for
but a few passages:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“This <i>Palace</i>, with wild prospects girded round,<br />
Stands in the middle of a falling ground,<br />
At a black <i>mountain’s</i> foot, whose craggy brow,<br />
Secures from <i>eastern tempests</i> all below,<br />
Under whose shelter <i>trees</i> and <i>flowers</i> grow,<br />
With early blossom, maugre native snow;<br />
Which elsewhere round a <i>tyranny</i> maintains,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>And binds crampt <i>nature</i> long in <i>crystal chains</i>.<br />
The <i>fabrick’s</i> noble front faces the <i>west</i>,<br />
Turning her fair broad shoulders to the <i>east</i>;<br />
On the <i>south</i> side the stately <i>gardens</i> lye,<br />
Where the scorn’d <i>Peak</i> rivals proud <i>Italy</i>.<br />
And on the <i>north</i> several inferior <i>plots</i><br />
For servile use do scatter’d lye in spots.</p>

<p class="ls3 pi6">****</p>

<p class="pp6q">Environ’d round with <i>Nature’s</i> shames and ills,<br />
Black heaths, wild rocks, bleak craggs and naked hills<br />
And the whole prospect so informe and rude,<br />
Who is it, but must presently conclude<br />
That this is <i>Paradise</i>, which seated stands<br />
In midst of <i>desarts</i>, and of barren <i>sands?</i>”</p>

<p class="p1">The engraving from Knyff’s drawing illustrates, to a remarkable degree,
this description by Cotton, but for our present purpose it is not necessary,
perhaps, to enter further into it. The house formed a quadrangle, the west
front being the principal. An enclosed carriage-drive with large gates led up
to the north front; the stables and stable-yard were at the north-west angle;
and the part where now the Italian garden stands, was a large square pool of
water with a fountain in its midst. Since then the whole of the grounds have
been remodelled, the immense fish-pools, the stables, &amp;c., taken away, and a
new part added to the mansion. The grounds were as fine, according to the
taste of the times, as any then existing, and the description given of them by
Charles Cotton brings vividly to the mind the time when “Sunday posies,”
of “roses and lilies and daffy-down-dillies” were in vogue, and when peonies
were worn in the button-hole; while rosemary and bay were the choicest of
scents.</p>

<p>Fountains and statues as described by Hobbes and by Cotton still adorn
the grounds, and it may be well to note that the busts on the pillars in the
Italian garden, which we engrave, originally belonged to the inner court of the
old mansion.</p>

<p>In 1687, William Cavendish, third Earl of Devonshire, who was afterwards
created Duke of Devonshire, after making considerable alterations in the
gardens and grounds, commenced rebuilding the house. The first part commenced
was the south front, which appears to have been begun to be rebuilt
on the 12th of April, 1687, under the direction of William Talman, the
architect. The east side next followed; the great hall and staircase being
covered in, in April, 1690. In 1692 Sir Christopher Wren came down and
surveyed the works, at which time it appears that about £9,000 had been
expended. In 1693 the east front and the north-east corner were commenced,
Talman receiving £600 in advance for the work. In 1700 the east front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
appears to have been completed, and about the same time the principal, or
west, front of the old mansion was taken down, and the rebuilding completed
in 1706. In 1703 the old south gallery was demolished and rebuilt, and in
1704 the north front was removed, and the building of the new one to take
its place commenced. The whole edifice appears to have been finished in
1706, but its noble owner, whose munificence and taste reared the magnificent
pile, did not long live to enjoy its beauties, for he died in the following year,
1707. Dr. White Kennett, Bishop of Peterborough, who preached the funeral
sermon of this nobleman, wrote at the time some account of the Cavendish
family, in the course of which he introduced some highly interesting particulars
relating to the mansion and grounds, remarking that “tho’ such a
vast pile (of materials entirely new) required a prodigious expense, yet the
building was the least charge, if regard be had to his gardens, water-works,
pictures, and other of the finest pieces of Art and Nature that could be
obtained abroad or at home.”</p>

<p>The Duke seems to have determined to erect a true Palace of Art, and for
that purpose he employed the best artists of the time in its decoration.
Among the painters employed to decorate the ceilings and walls of the
various rooms with the creations of their genius, were Verrio, Laguerre, Sir
James Thornhill, Ricard, Highmore (sergeant-painter to William III.), Price,
and Huyd. The carvers in stone and wood, whose names appear in the
accounts, were Caius Gabriel Cibber, Samuel Watson, Henry Watson his son,
Mons. Nadauld, J. T. Geeraerslius, Augustine Harris, Nost, William Davies,
M. Auriol, Joel Lobb, and Lanscroon. The principal iron-worker appears to
have been Mons. Tijou, a French smith, whose daughter was wife of Laguerre
the painter; and the lead-worker, who did the regular plumber’s work, as well
as the lead-piping of the willow-tree, and other water-works under the
guidance of Mons. Grillet, was a Mr. Cock, of London, whose bill came to
about £1,000.</p>

<p>In 1820 the late Duke&mdash;William Spencer Cavendish, sixth Duke of Devonshire&mdash;who
had succeeded to the title in 1811, commenced some great
improvements at Chatsworth by erecting, from the designs of Sir Jeffrey
Wyatt, the north wing, containing, with all the domestic offices, a number of
other apartments, as well as the dining-room, sculpture-gallery, orangery,
banqueting-room, and pavilion; and by altering and re-arranging several
other rooms. The grounds and gardens, also, were by this gifted nobleman,
very materially remodelled and improved under the direction of his head-gardener,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the late Sir Joseph Paxton, to whose labours, including the erection
of the gigantic conservatory, the forming of the artificial rocks, &amp;c., we shall
have to refer.</p>

<p>Having now traced so far as is necessary for our present purpose the
history of Chatsworth, we proceed to speak of the noble and historical family
of Cavendish, its princely owners. This, however, we shall do but briefly;
having already, in our account of Hardwick Hall, gone into the family history
at some length.</p>

<p>The family of Cavendish, to whose noble head Chatsworth belongs, traces
back to the Conquest, when Robert de Gernon, who came over with the
Conqueror, was rewarded by him for his services with large grants of lands in
Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, &amp;c. His descendants held considerable land
in Derbyshire; and Sir William Gernon, <i>temp.</i> Henry III., had two sons, Sir
Ralph de Gernon, lord of Bakewell, and Geoffrey de Gernon, of Moor Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
near Bakewell. From the second of these, Geoffrey de Gernon, the
Cavendishes are descended; his son, Roger de Gernon (who died in 1334),
having married the heiress of the lord of the manor of Cavendish, in Suffolk;
and by her had issue four sons, who all assumed the name of Cavendish from
that manor. These sons were Sir John Cavendish, Chief Justice of the King’s
Bench; Roger Cavendish, from whom descended the celebrated navigator, Sir
Thomas Cavendish; Stephen Cavendish, Lord Mayor of London; and Richard
Cavendish. Sir John married Alice Odyngseles, who brought to her husband
the manor of Cavendish Overhall; and their eldest son, Sir Andrew Cavendish,
left issue, one son, William, from whom the estates passed to his cousin. Sir
Andrew was succeeded by his brother, Sir John Cavendish, who, for his
gallant conduct in killing the rebel, Wat Tyler, was knighted by the king; he
married Joan, daughter to Sir William Clopton, and was succeeded by his
eldest son, William, a citizen and mercer of London, who married Joan
Staventon, by whom he had issue two sons, the eldest of whom, Thomas,
succeeded him; and whose son and heir, Sir Thomas Cavendish, Clerk of the
Pipe, &amp;c., married twice, and left by his first wife three sons, George
Cavendish, who wrote the “Life of Cardinal Wolsey,” Sir William Cavendish,
and Sir Thomas Cavendish. The second of these sons, Sir William Cavendish,
became the founder of the present ducal house of Devonshire and of several
other noble families. He married, first, a daughter of Edward Bostock, of
Whatcross, in Cheshire; second, a daughter of Sir Thomas Conyngsby, and
widow of William Paris; and third, Elizabeth, daughter of John Hardwick,
of Hardwick, Derbyshire, and widow of Robert Barley, of Barley, in the same
county. Of this lady, who became much celebrated as the Countess of
Shrewsbury&mdash;“Bess of Hardwick,” as she was called&mdash;an account will be
found in the present volume under the head of Hardwick Hall. By these
three wives Sir William had a numerous family. By his first he had one son
and two daughters who died young, and two daughters who married; by his
second he had three daughters, who died young; and by his third (“Bess
of Hardwick”), he had also several children. These were Henry Cavendish
of Tutbury; Sir William Cavendish, created Earl of Devonshire, and who
was the direct ancestor of the Dukes of Devonshire; Sir Charles Cavendish,
whose son was created Baron Cavendish of Bolsover, Baron Ogle,
Viscount Mansfield, and Earl, Marquis, and Duke of Newcastle; Frances,
married to Sir Henry Pierrepoint, ancestor of the Duke of Kingston; Elizabeth,
married to Charles Stuart, Duke of Lennox (brother of Lord Darnley, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, and father of King James I.), the issue of
which marriage was the ill-fated Arabella Stuart, who was born at Chatsworth;
and Mary, who became the wife of Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury. Sir
William Cavendish was succeeded by his son, Sir William Cavendish, who
was created Baron Cavendish of Hardwick, and Earl of Devonshire, by King
James I., “at which time of his creation his Majesty stood under a cloth of
state in the hall at Greenwich, accompanied with the princes, his children, the
Duke of Holstein, the Duke of Lennox, and the greatest part of the nobility,
both of England and Scotland.” The earl married, first, Anne, daughter of
Henry Kighley, of Kighley; and, second, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward
Boughton, and widow of Sir Richard Wortley.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his second son by his first wife, Sir William
Cavendish, as second Earl of Devonshire. This nobleman&mdash;who had been
under the tuition of the famous philosopher, Thomas Hobbes&mdash;married
Christiana, only daughter of Edward, Lord Bruce of Kinloss, a kinswoman of
the king, “who gave her with his own hand, and made her fortune ten
thousand pounds.” By her he had issue three sons and one daughter, and
was succeeded by his eldest son, William, as third Earl of Devonshire, who
was only ten years of age at his father’s death. This nobleman married
Elizabeth Cecil, daughter of the Earl of Salisbury, by whom he had two
sons, William (who succeeded him) and Charles, and one daughter. William,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
fourth Earl of Devonshire, before succeeding to the title, was one of the
train-bearers to the king on his coronation, and sat in the Long Parliament
as member for Derbyshire. His lordship was one of the principals in bringing
about “the Glorious Revolution” of 1688, and placing William III. on the
throne; the place of meeting for plotting for the great and good change being
on Whittington Moor, not many miles from Chatsworth, at a small cottage-inn
belonging to the Duke of Devonshire, known as the “Cock and Pynot”
(<i>pynot</i> being the provincial name of the magpie), still existing, but recently
partly rebuilt. The “plotting parlour,” as the room in this cottage is called,
in which the Earl of Devonshire met Earl Danby, John d’Arcy, and others, to
plan the revolution, is held in veneration, and the very chair in which the earl
sat during the deliberations is preserved by his Grace at Hardwick Hall,
where it has been taken, and is, indeed, a most interesting historical relic.
The earl, who, as we have already stated, was the rebuilder of Chatsworth,
married Mary, daughter of the Duke of Ormonde, by whom he had issue
three sons, William (his successor), Henry, and James; and one daughter,
Elizabeth. His lordship was, in 1694, advanced by William III. to the
dignity of Marquis of Hartington and Duke of Devonshire. He died in 1707,
and was succeeded, as second duke and fifth earl, by his son, William
Cavendish, captain of the yeomen of the guard to the king, who succeeded to
all his father’s appointments, including being Lord Steward of the Household,
Privy Councillor, Lord Warden and Chief Justice in Eyre, Lord Lieutenant,
K.G., &amp;c.; he was also made one of the Regents of the kingdom. His grace
married Rachel, daughter of William, Lord Russel, and on his death was
succeeded by his son William as third Duke of Devonshire.</p>

<p>The third Duke, who became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Keeper of
the Privy Seal, Lord Steward of the Household, Lord Justice for the administration
of government during the king’s absence, Lord Lieutenant of
Derbyshire, &amp;c., married Catherine, heiress of John Hoskins, by whom he
had a numerous family. He was succeeded by his son&mdash;</p>

<p>William, as fourth Duke of Devonshire, who had, during his father’s lifetime,
been called to the Upper House by the title, hitherto of courtesy, of
Marquis of Hartington. His grace was made Master of the Horse, a Privy
Councillor, one of the Lords of the Regency, Governor of the County of Cork,
Lord High Treasurer of Ireland, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, First Commissioner
of the Treasury, and Chamberlain of the Household, &amp;c. He
married Charlotte, daughter, and ultimately heiress, of Richard Boyle, Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
of Burlington and Cork, by which alliance&mdash;the lady being Baroness Clifford
in her own right&mdash;the barony of Clifford came into the Cavendish family.
The issue of this marriage was three sons and one daughter&mdash;viz., William,
who succeeded to the title and estates; Lord Richard, who died unmarried;
Lord George Augustus Henry, who was created Earl of Burlington, from
whom the present noble Duke of Devonshire is descended; and Lady
Dorothy, married to the Duke of Portland.</p>

<p>William, fifth Duke of Devonshire, married&mdash;first, the Lady Georgiana,
daughter of Earl Spencer, one of the most accomplished and elegant women
of the time, and who is best and most emphatically known as “the beautiful
Duchess,” by whom he had issue one son, William Spencer Cavendish (who
succeeded him), and two daughters, the Lady Georgiana, married to the
Earl of Carlisle; and the Lady Harriet Elizabeth, married to Earl Granville.
His grace married secondly the Lady Elizabeth Foster, daughter of the Earl
of Bristol, and widow of John Thomas Foster, Esq. On his death, in 1811,
the title and estates passed to his only son&mdash;</p>

<p>William Spencer Cavendish, sixth Duke and ninth Earl of Devonshire, one
of the most kindly, generous, and liberal-minded men, and one of the most
zealous patrons of art and literature. He was born in Paris in 1790, and,
besides holding the office of Lord High Chamberlain, &amp;c., went on a special
embassy to Russia from the British court. This embassy his grace conducted
on a scale of princely magnificence at his own charge, and concluded it to the
entire satisfaction of both nations. By him the modern improvements of
Chatsworth were, with master-mind and lavish hand, planned and carried out.
His grace, who never married, died in January, 1858, and was succeeded in
his titles and estates&mdash;with the exception of the barony of Clifford, which fell
into abeyance between his sisters&mdash;by his second cousin, the present noble
head of the house, who was grandson of the first Earl of Burlington. The
sixth Duke&mdash;the “Good Duke,” for by that title he is known best, and it is
as amply merited by the present noble peer&mdash;was, by express wish, buried
in the churchyard at Edensor, just outside the park at Chatsworth, where
a plain and perfectly simple coped tomb, with foliated cross, covers his
remains.</p>

<p>The present noble owner of princely Chatsworth, William Cavendish,
seventh Duke of Devonshire, Marquis of Hartington, Earl of Devonshire, Earl
of Burlington, Baron Cavendish of Hardwick, Baron Cavendish of Keighley,
&amp;c., Knight of the Garter, LL.D., F.R.S., Lord Lieutenant and Custos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Rotulorum of the County of Derby, Chancellor of the University of Cambridge,
High Steward of the Borough of Derby, &amp;c., was born 27th April, 1808.
His grace is the eldest son of William Cavendish, eldest son (by his wife the
Lady Elizabeth Compton, daughter and heiress of Charles, seventh Earl of
Northampton), of George Augustus Henry Cavendish (third son of the fourth
Duke of Devonshire, by his wife the Lady Charlotte Boyle, as already stated),
first Earl of Burlington, and Baron Cavendish, of Keighley, which titles were
created in his favour in 1831: he died in 1834. William Cavendish, just
referred to, was born in 1783, and in 1807 married the Hon. Louisa
O’Callaghan, eldest daughter of Cornelius, first Baron Lismore, by whom he
had issue three sons and one daughter, viz., the present Duke of Devonshire;
Lord George Henry Cavendish, the present highly-respected M.P. for North
Derbyshire, of Ashford Hall, in that county, married to Lady Louisa, youngest
daughter of the second Earl of Harewood; Lady Fanny Cavendish, married
to Frederick John Howard, Esq.; and Lord Richard Cavendish, all of whom
are still living. Mr. Cavendish died in 1812, before his eldest child, the
present Duke, was four years of age, his wife surviving him until 1864. His
grace was educated at Eton, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he
graduated as M.A., and was Second Wrangler, Senior Smith’s Prizeman, and
in the first class of the Classical Tripos, 1829. In the same year he became
M.P. for the University of Cambridge, which seat he held until 1831, when he
was returned for Malton, and in the same year, as Lord Cavendish, for
Derbyshire, and at the general election in the following year, for North
Derbyshire, which constituency he represented until 1834, when he succeeded
his grandfather as second Earl of Burlington. In 1856 he was, as Earl of
Burlington, made Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire, a post he held until 1858,
when, on succeeding to the Dukedom of Devonshire, he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant
of Derbyshire. From 1836 to 1858 he was Chancellor of the
University of London, and, besides many other important appointments, is at
the present time President of Owen’s College, Manchester.</p>

<p>His grace, at that time Mr. Cavendish, married, 1829, his cousin, the
Lady Blanche Georgiana Howard, fourth daughter of the sixth Earl of
Carlisle, by his wife the Lady Georgiana Dorothy Cavendish, daughter
of the fifth Duke of Devonshire. By this beautiful and accomplished, as
well as truly estimable lady, who died in 1840, his grace had issue four
sons and one daughter, who, with the exception of the eldest, are still living.
These are&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>1st. Spencer Compton Cavendish, Marquis of Hartington, M.P., P.C.,
LL.D., was born in 1833, and is unmarried. The Marquis was educated at
Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as B.A. in 1852, M.A. in
1854, and LL.D. in 1862. He holds at the present time the responsible post
of Her Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State for Ireland, and has successively
held office as a Lord of the Admiralty, Under-Secretary of State for War,
Secretary of State for War, and Postmaster-General, and was attached to
Lord Granville’s special mission to Russia.</p>

<p>2nd. The Lady Louisa Caroline Cavendish, born in 1835, and married in
1865 to Admiral the Hon. Francis Egerton, R.N., M.P. for East Derbyshire,
son of the first Earl of Ellesmere, by whom she has issue two sons and one
daughter.</p>

<p>3rd. Lord Frederick Charles Cavendish, M.P. for the north division of
the West Riding of Yorkshire, born in 1836, and married in 1864 to the Hon.
Lucy Caroline, daughter of Baron Lyttelton.</p>

<p>4th. Lord Edward Cavendish, late M.P. for East Sussex, born in 1838,
and married in 1865 to Emma Elizabeth Lascelles, a maid of honour to the
Queen, and granddaughter to the Earl of Harewood, by whom he has issue
two sons.</p>

<p>His grace is patron of thirty-nine livings, and in Derbyshire alone is lord
of forty-six manors. His other seats are:&mdash;Hardwick Hall, Derbyshire, about
fifteen miles from Chatsworth; Holkar Hall, in Cartmel; Bolton Abbey,
Yorkshire; Lismore Castle, Ireland; Compton Place, Eastbourne, Sussex;
and Devonshire House, London.</p>

<p>The arms of the Duke of Devonshire are&mdash;<i>sable</i>, three harts’ heads,
caboshed, <i>argent</i>, attired, <i>or</i>. Crest: a serpent noued, <i>proper</i>. Supporters:
two bucks, <i>proper</i>, each wreathed round the neck with a chaplet of roses,
alternately <i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>.</p>

<p>There are four principal entrances to Chatsworth Park, two of which&mdash;those
at Edensor and Edensor Mill&mdash;are public, and the other two (at Baslow
and at Beeley) are private. The Baslow Lodge, shown on our engraving,
is stately and noble in the extreme, and forms a fitting entrance to so magnificent
a domain. The Beeley Lodge is simple and unassuming; and that at
Edensor, with its rustic cottages, remarkably pretty. The most picturesque,
however, in regard to its situation, is the Edensor Mill Lodge, which we also
engrave. Near it runs the river Derwent, spanned by the single arch of
Beeley Bridge, and it is charmingly embosomed in trees and shrubs.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Grand Entrance-Lodge at Baslow.</i></p>
</div>

<p>By whichever of the lodges the visitor enters this “wide domain,”&mdash;if
from the south, it will be at Edensor Mill or Beeley, and from the north and
other parts at Edensor or Baslow,&mdash;he will have a rich treat, indeed, of
scenery to interest him on his progress to the mansion. The park is
divided in two by the river Derwent, which flows through it, the mansion
and the Baslow and Beeley Lodges being on one side, and Edensor,
Edensor Lodge, and Edensor Mill Lodge on the other. From either
of these latter routes, which are on the higher side of the park, the
visitor obtains the finest views of the house and grounds, and will, in his
approach, cross the Derwent by the elegant bridge shown in the engraving on
page 343.</p>

<p>Arrived at the house, he will&mdash;after proper application at the Lodge,
and the necessary permission obtained&mdash;be ushered through the exquisitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
beautiful gates shown on the engraving on the next page, and be conducted
through the court-yard&mdash;where stands a magnificent weeping ash-tree,
of enormous size (we well remember seeing it removed, bodily, from
Mile-Ash, near Derby, to its present proud position, as long ago as 1830)&mdash;to
the state entrance. Admitted to the princely mansion, the first room the
visitor enters is&mdash;</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sub-Hall</span>, a spacious apartment, the ceiling of which is enriched by
a copy of Guido’s “Aurora,” painted by Miss Curzon. The sculpture in this
sub-hall includes a statue of Domitian; busts of Homer, Jupiter, Ariadne,
Socrates, Caracalla, and others. From this hall the visitor next enters the
North Corridor, and, turning to his left, passes along its exquisitely inlaid
marble floor, to the Great Hall, which occupies the whole length of the
eastern side of the quadrangle.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Hall</span>, or <span class="smcap">Grand Hall</span>, is a noble room, 60 feet in length
by 27 feet in width, and of the full height of the two principal stories of
the mansion. The floor is formed of polished marble, laid in a remarkably
striking geometric design, in mosaic, of black and white and veined marbles.
It was originally the work of Henry Watson, being laid down by him in
1779; but was taken up and relaid, with considerable alterations, by the late
Duke. In the centre of the hall stands an immense marble table, of
Derbyshire marble, and the chimney-piece, which is very massive, is also of
marble. At the south end of the hall is the grand staircase, leading to
the state apartments, and at the north end, beyond the corridor, are the
north stairs. The hall is four windows
in length, and galleries of communication
between the north and
south run, midway in height, along
the sides. The ceiling and walls of
the upper story are painted in the
most masterly manner in historical
subjects, by Laguerre and Verrio.
The series of subjects are events in
the life of Julius Cæsar:&mdash;They are,
his passing the Rubicon; his passing
over to his army at Brundusium;
sacrificing before going to the Senate,
after the closing of the temple of
Janus; and his death in the Senate
House at the foot of Pompey’s pillar;
and on the ceiling is his apotheosis
or deification. Between the windows, and in the window-cases, are also
painted trophies of arms, and wreaths of flowers, &amp;c. In the hall are two
remarkably fine bronze busts placed upon pedestals, and other interesting
objects, among which is a fine canoe, the gift of the Sultan to the
late Duke. Over the fire-place is a marble tablet bearing the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">“ÆDES HAS PATERNAS DILECTISSIMAS.<br />
ANNO LIBERTATIS ANGLICÆ MDCLXXXVIII INSTITUTAS.<br />

ANNO MŒRORIS SUI MDCCCXL PERPECIT;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">which may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">“These well-loved ancestral halls,<br />
Begun in the year of English Freedom, 1688,<br />
William Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, inherited in 1811,<br />
And completed in the year of sorrow, 1840.”</p>

<p class="pn1">The “year of sorrow,” so touchingly alluded to, being that of the death of
the much-loved and highly-gifted Countess of Burlington, the wife of the
present noble owner of Chatsworth. On the exterior of this grand hall,
on the east side of the quadrangle, are some trophies of arms, &amp;c., magnificently
and boldly carved in <i>alto-relievo</i> in stone, by Watson.</p>

<p>In this hall, of which our engraving gives but a sorry representation, the
visitor is usually asked to remain for a short time, and to inscribe his name in
the visitors’ book on the central table. From the centre of the south end
of this noble room, the grand staircase leads up to the various suites of apartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
on the library and state-room stories, and on either side of this staircase
an open archway gives access to the “Grotto-Room,” the south corridor,
and the apartments on the ground floor. From the corridor at the north end,
the north stairs give access in like manner to the various apartments and to
the north wing.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Great Hall and Staircase.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The house is three stories in height, and these are known as the basement,
the library, and the state-room stories. Through the extreme kindness and
liberality of the noble Duke a part of each of these stories is, under proper
regulations, permitted to be shown to visitors. It is not our intention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
describe these various apartments in the order in which they are shown to
visitors&mdash;for this would for many reasons be an inconvenient and unwise
arrangement&mdash;but will speak of them according to the stories on which they
occur. And first we take the upper, or state-room story, which, like the
others, runs round the four sides of the quadrangle. The State-rooms and
Sketch-Gallery occupy the south side; the grand staircase is at the south-east
angle; the continuation of the gallery of old masters, the west stairs,
and a number of bed-rooms, including the Sabine-room, occupy the west
side; the north is taken up with bed-rooms, with the north staircase
at the north-east angle; while on the east are “Mary Queen of Scots’
Rooms,” so called because occupying the same position as those used
by her in the old mansion which was removed and rebuilt, and other
suites of splendid sleeping apartments which of course are not shown to
the visitor.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sketch-Gallery</span>, which, as we have said, occupies the south and
a part of the west side, contains perhaps the most choice and extensive collection
of original drawings by the old masters in any private collection,
embracing the Italian, French, Flemish, Venetian, Spanish, and other schools;
and containing matchless examples of Raffaelle, Michael Angelo, Albert Dürer,
Titian, Rembrandt, Rubens, Leonardo da Vinci, Poussin, Claude, Salvator
Rosa, Correggio, Luca Signorelli, Andrea del Sarto, Lo Spagna, Giulio
Romano, Caravaggio, Zucchero, Andrea Mantegna, Parmigiano, Giorgione,
Giulio Campagnola, Paul Veronese, the Carracci, Guido Reni, Domenichino,
Guercino, Holbein, Lucas Cranach, Lucas Van Leyden, Vandyke, Van der
Velde, Jan Miel, and indeed of almost every well-known name. The collection
was formed by the second Duke of Devonshire at considerable cost;
the nucleus being purchased at Rotterdam. Among those by Michael Angelo
are a study for the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; some spirited studies of
figures for the same ceiling; and a Virgin and Child. By Leonardo da Vinci
a fine head of the Virgin. By Raffaelle are the sketch for the picture by
Pinturicchio at Sienna, of “Æneas Silvius kissing the foot of Pope Eugenius IV.
at the Council of Basle;” the figure of St. Paul for the cartoon of “The
Sacrifice at Lystra;” “St. Catherine,” the original sketch for the picture now
in the National Gallery; “the Virgin and Child;” “Joseph discovering

     <p class="pc"><i>Vista of the State Apartments.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The State-apartments, which are entered from this Gallery, consist of a
splendid suite of rooms, occupying the entire length of the building. The
entrance is through a small apartment around the walls of which is arranged
a fine collection of examples of Ceramic Art, including many good specimens
of the more famous English and foreign makes. These were, in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
measure, removed here from the Duke’s villa at Chiswick. Adjoining this,
at the south-west angles, is&mdash;</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">State Dressing-Room</span>, the coved ceiling of which is beautifully
painted, the subject being, in the centre, the flight of Mercury on his mission
to Paris, and, on the coving, groups representing the Arts and Sciences. The
wood-carving in this room, as in the whole of this suite of apartments, is of
the most wonderful and most exquisitely beautiful character, and is unmatched
in any other existing mansion. On the west side are four pendants and a
group of the most delicate workmanship, and over the principal doorway is
represented a group of carvers’ tools, &amp;c.&mdash;a globe, compass, brace and bit,
square, augurs, chisels, gouges, <i>cum multis aliis</i>, and a small bust. This
apartment contains some fine Japan, inlaid, and other cabinets, and curious
old earthenware; and on the walls, besides a clever picture in mosaic, is a
frame containing what is universally admitted to be the finest and most
wonderful specimen of wood-carving ever executed;&mdash;this we engrave. It is
usually called “Grinling Gibbons’ masterpiece,” and whether by Gibbons
or not (and there is no direct authority either one way or other), it is, <i>indeed</i>,
a masterpiece of art. Concerning the question whether the carving is by
Gibbons or not, we shall have a few words to say when writing of the chapel.
The “masterpiece” is a group consisting of a cravat of point-lace, as clear and
delicate in the open-work as the finest lace itself, a woodcock, some foliage,
and a medal with a bust in relief. Of this group Horace Walpole thus
wrote:&mdash;“When Gibbons had finished his work at that palace (Chatsworth)
he presented the Duke with a point cravat, a woodcock, and a medal with his
own head, all preserved in a glass-case in the gallery;” but he had no
authority for any such statement, nor is there any record of Gibbons having
ever been at Chatsworth. From the door of this room the vista, when looking
through the state-apartments, is remarkably striking and effective; the flooring
throughout the suite being of oak parqueterie which reflects the light in a
pleasing manner. This we engrave.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Old State-Bed-room</span>, the first apartment seen through the doorway
in our engraving, is a fine and very interesting apartment. The ceiling, which
is coved, is splendidly painted, the principal subject being “Aurora chasing
away the Night;” and the walls are hung with embossed leather of rich
arabesque pattern, heavily gilded; the frieze, also of embossed leather, is
richly foliated, with medallions bearing respectively the bust of the late Duke
of Devonshire, his crest and coronet, and his monogram, alternating round the
room. Over the doorways are splendid examples of wood-carving of groups
of musical instruments; on one group is suspended a medallion head of
Charles II., and the words “<span class="smcap">Carolvs II. Dei Gratia</span>,” and on the other a
watch. Over and around the chimney-piece are cherubs’ heads, birds, foliage,
&amp;c., of the same fine class of wood-carving. In this room (besides cabinets,
vases, and beakers, and a charming model of the tomb of Madame Langlan, at
Hildebank, near Berne, in which the spirits of the mother and child are seen
bursting through their broken tomb) is a noble and ancient embroidered
canopy and state-chair, the work of Christiana, Countess of Devonshire, the
wife of the second Earl of Devonshire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Old State Bed-room.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The canopy is of crimson velvet,
exquisitely covered with needlework in gold and colours, in groups of figures,
trees, animals, and insects;&mdash;here, a goat, a stag, a fox, a rabbit, a pig, dogs
both leashed and single, a horse, an eagle, and a swan; there, butterflies, flies,
and innumerable other devices around; while inside the top a group of three
figures within a border is in the centre, and the rest dotted with animals,
flowers, &amp;c., with a border of figures and foliage. The back of the canopy
bears, above the chair, the arms of Cavendish (<i>sable</i>, three bucks’ heads
caboshed, <i>argent</i>, attired <i>or</i>) impaling those of Bruce of Kinloss (<i>or</i>, a saltire
and a chief, <i>gules</i>, on a canton, <i>argent</i>, a lion rampant, <i>azure</i>), with mantling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
helmet, crest, &amp;c. Supporters, dexter, a stag, proper, gorged with a wreath
of roses, <i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>, attired <i>or</i>, for Cavendish; sinister, a wild man,
proper, wreathed round the head and loins with laurel, <i>vert</i>, for Bruce.
Motto, <span class="smcap">Cavendo Tvtvs Fvimvs</span>; the first part, “Cavendo Tvtvs,” being the
Cavendish motto, and the latter part, “Fvimvs,” that of Bruce; the rest of
the velvet is covered with flowers, animals, &amp;c., and surrounded by a border
of groups and flowers. The chair is of the same character, Christiana,
Countess of Devonshire, to whose fair hands is owing this charming piece of
embroidery, and to whose good taste the arrangement of these blended
armorial insignia is due, was the daughter of Edward, Lord Bruce of
Kinloss, and sister of the first Earl of Elgin, from whom the present
ninth Earl is lineally descended. The armorial bearings upon this canopy
are therefore peculiarly interesting as showing, not only the impaled arms
themselves, but the blended supporters and motto, of Cavendish and Bruce.
In this room are also preserved the coronation chairs and foot-stools of
George III., and Queen Charlotte, and of William IV. and Queen Adelaide;
and a wardrobe which is said, whether correctly or not, to have belonged to
Louis XVI.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">State Music-room</span>, like the others, contains some exquisite wood-carving.
Over one doorway are flowers, fruit, wreaths, wings, &amp;c., and a
ribbon with the family motto “<span class="smcap">Cavendo Tvtvs</span>;” over the other, flowers,
fruit, and cornucopia; and over the chimney-piece are heads, festoons,
flowers, fruit, corn, foliage, &amp;c., all true to nature. Over the central door is
a group of musical instruments, and in the centre of the frieze is a garter and
monogram. The walls are hung with embossed leather, richly gilt and
heightened with blue, and the frieze has the medallion heads, crest, and monogram
of the late Duke, as in the apartment just described. The ceiling is
splendidly painted with mythological subjects, and several interesting pictures,
busts, and other objects, are arranged in the room. One of the features of this
apartment remains to be noticed. It is a curious piece of deceptive painting
on one of the double doors leading to the gallery&mdash;a fiddle painted so cleverly
on the door itself as to have, in the subdued light of the half-closed door, all
the appearance of the instrument itself hanging upon a peg. The tradition of
Chatsworth is, that this matchless piece of painting was done by Verrio to
deceive Gibbons, who, in his carvings, had deceived others by his close
imitation of nature.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">State Drawing-room</span> has its walls hung with tapestry from Raffaelle’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
cartoons, and its carved ceiling is splendidly painted with mythological
and allegorical subjects, in the same manner as the rest of this suite of
rooms. The carving over one of the doors is a military trophy, consisting
of swords, drum, battle-axes, shield, helmet, with dragon crest, foliage, &amp;c.;
and over the other, military music and foliage. Above the chimney-piece,
around an oval in which is a portrait of the first Duke, are Cupids, trophies,
shells, foliage, masks, helmets, arms, &amp;c., and an owl; beneath these are
two carved banners with the Cavendish arms, tied together with a snake
(the family crest). Among the furniture and adornments of this room
are some fine examples of china and earthenware, and a remarkably large
malachite table.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The State Drawing-room.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">State Dining-room</span>, which forms the south-east angle of the building,
is a splendid apartment, the ceiling of which, by Verrio, is of the most
masterly conception, and represents, among an assemblage of gods and goddesses,
the Fates cutting the thread of life, &amp;c., and on one side of the coving
is a monogram of the letter D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The State Dining-room.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The carvings in this noble apartment are of
matchless character, and hang in a profusion that is almost bewildering. In
the panels of the wainscoted walls are festoons of flowers, &amp;c.; over one
doorway is a group of leaves and corn, and over the other two are splendid
groups of crabs, lobsters, fish, and shells, all “as true to nature as nature
itself.” Over the fire-place, across the top, and hanging down the sides of an
octagonal tablet, is the richest of all the rich carvings of this suite of rooms.
It consists of dead game&mdash;heron, pheasants, &amp;c., at the top; over and around
these a net is loosely thrown, which, hanging down the sides, forms a groundwork
of festoons, on which hang pheasants, woodcocks, grouse, partridges,
snipes, and other birds, so true to life that it is only by careful examination
that the spectator can discover that they, with the net and all the mouldings,
are carved out of solid wood. In this room are several busts in marble by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Chantrey, Nollekens, and others. Among these are the Emperor Nicholas
of Russia, and his Empress; Fox; Canning; Francis, Duke of Bedford;
Lord G. H. Cavendish, &amp;c. There are also cabinets of rare old china.
On the central table will be noticed, among rare and valuable articles, the
rosary of King Henry VIII.; a fine set of carved ivory chessmen; ivory-carvings,
rare glass and china; and silver filigree and other ornaments. And
there is also the malachite clock presented to the late Duke by the Emperor
Nicholas of Russia, and an exquisitely sculptured marble model of the Victoria
Regia.</p>

<p>From this room a doorway opens on to the <span class="smcap">Grand Staircase</span>&mdash;the casings
of the doorways, of exquisitely-carved marble, being worthy of especial note&mdash;in
the south-east angle. Opposite this doorway another door opens into a
suite of apartments, of course not shown to visitors, but to which some brief
allusion may here be made. Here are the rooms usually known as <span class="smcap">Mary
Queen of Scots’ Rooms</span>, but which really have no possible connection with
that ill-fated lady. They are so called because they occupy the same position
in the present building as those used by her did in the old one; they overlook
the inner court, or quadrangle, on its east side. The other suites of bed-rooms
adjoining are known as the “Leicester” and “Wellington” rooms,
and they are fitted, as may well be supposed, in a style of princely magnificence.
In one of these rooms is the bed and bed-room suite used by Her
Majesty Queen Victoria when a guest at Chatsworth. This suite is of satin-wood,
hung in green and white satin.</p>

<p>On this same floor is the <span class="smcap">Sabine-room</span>, so called from the subject of the
“Rape of the Sabines,” by which it is adorned. This singular apartment,
when the doors are closed, is one large painting, the whole surface, from
floor to ceiling, doors included, being painted with figures, groups, and architecture,
&amp;c. The ceiling, too, is splendidly painted with an allegorical
subject. At the angles of the coving is the monogram of the Duke of Devonshire,
within a garter, and surmounted by the Ducal coronet. The furniture
of this and the adjoining room is of the finest, most massive, and sumptuous
description.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Middle</span>, or <span class="smcap">Library Story</span>, besides occupying the four sides of the
quadrangle or inner court (in the same manner as the upper story), extends
the whole length of the north wing; it is, therefore, the most extensive and
important part of the mansion. The grand staircase is at the inner south-east
angle, and the north stairs at the inner north-east angle. The south side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
is taken up with the gallery of paintings, the chapel (at the south-west angle),
the billiard-rooms, and the two drawing-rooms; the west by the gallery of
paintings, the west staircase, and suites of bed-rooms; the north side by the
library-corridor and sumptuous bed-rooms, &amp;c.; and the east side by galleries
of the great hall, and the library and ante-library. The north wing, continuing
in a line with the libraries, comprises the dining-room, sculpture-gallery,
and orangery.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Gallery of Paintings</span>, which occupies two sides of the quadrangle,
and from which access is had to the various apartments, contains, with the
adjoining ante-room, many remarkably fine and valuable art-treasures&mdash;such,
indeed, as no other mansion can boast. Among these, it will be sufficient to
name Landseer’s original paintings of “Bolton Abbey in the Olden Time,”
and “Laying down the Law,” a number of family portraits by Reynolds,
Lawrence, and others; with two remarkable representations of the old
mansion, one of which we engrave on page 325.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Billiard</span> or <span class="smcap">Music-room</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Grand Drawing-rooms</span>, which form
one continued suite, are as well-proportioned, as chastely and elegantly decorated,
and as magnificently furnished, as can well be imagined, and they
contain a matchless collection of works of art. In the billiard-room, from
which a door opens into the gallery of the chapel, are several remarkably good
paintings, the most striking of which are an admirable full-length portrait
of the present Duke of Devonshire, seated, and a full-length portrait of the
father of the present noble Duke. Among the treasures of art in the drawing-room
(the ornaments of the ceiling and cornices of which are richly gilt) may
just be named Reynolds’s celebrated portrait of “the beautiful Duchess” of
Devonshire, Rembrandt’s grand head of a Jewish Rabbi, and picture-gems by
Claude, Murillo, Bassano, Steinwyck, Salvator Rosa, Titian, Berghem, Gaspar
Poussin, Leonardo da Vinci, Primaticcio, Parmigiano, Watteau, Teniers,
Breughel, Guercino, Giordione, Carlo Maratti, Jan Miel, and others.</p>

<p>In the Grand Drawing-room, which has a splendid ceiling divided into
compartments, and, with the massive panellings of the pictures let into the
walls, is richly gilt, are some rare and priceless full-length paintings. These
are Philip II., by Titian; Admiral Capella, and Antonio de Dominis, by
Tintoretto; the Duke of Albemarle, by Dobson; Henry VIII., by Holbein;
Mary Queen of Scots, by Zucchero; and Charles I., by Jansen. The furniture
is of the most sumptuous character, and every elegancy which the most
perfect taste can desire, or the most liberal expenditure secure, adds endless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
charms to the room. We engrave one portion of this apartment, and also
the Hebe of Canova, with which, and other rarities, it is graced.</p>

<p>From the south windows of this suite of rooms a magnificent view of the
grounds is obtained. Immediately beneath is the spacious lawn, bordered
with raised parterres, festoon flower-beds, and sculpture; in the centre of the
lawn is a basin with a central and four other fountains. Beyond this is seen
the lake, with the “Emperor” fountain casting up its waters to an enormous
height, and skirted on its sloping sides with majestic forest trees, and with
grassy slopes and statuary; the park stretching out to the right. From the
east window of the drawing-room the view is equally fine, but of different
character. Here is seen, in all its beauty, the wonderful cascade shown in
one of our engravings, the waters of which come rolling down from the dome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
of the temple to the head of the
broad walk in the middle of the
grassy slope where it disappears
under the ground and is no more
seen. To the right and left
beautiful glimpses of the grounds
are obtained, while beneath the
window, to the right, a flight of
steps, guarded by two sculptured
lions, forms a striking foreground.
From this room, besides the doorway
which connects it with
apartments we have been describing,
one door gives access to
the grand staircase, and another
to the library.</p>

<p>Of the various apartments
composing the north and west
sides, it will be unnecessary for
our present purpose here to
speak, further than to say that
they are as sumptuously and
as tastefully arranged and furnished
as such a palace with such
a princely owner requires.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Library</span>, which is about
90 feet long by 23 in width,
and of corresponding height, is
one of the most elegant, best
arranged, and most perfect
libraries in existence. This
noble apartment has eight windows
in length on its east side,
between which are presses for
books, surmounted by looking-glass;
the opposite side and the
ends are also lined with books,
and an elegant gallery, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
access is had by a concealed spiral staircase, runs along the ends and
one side. The ceiling is white and gold, and is adorned with three large,
and five smaller, circular paintings of the most exquisite colouring, by
Louis Charon. The mahogany book-cases are divided into presses by
gilt metal-columns, from which stand out the brackets supporting the
gallery.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>The Library.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The chimney-piece, of Carrara marble, has beautifully sculptured
columns with wreaths of foliage, and is surmounted by candelabra, massive
vases, and a magnificent mirror. In the glass-cases and table-presses, as well
as on the shelves, are preserved, as may well be supposed, one of the richest
and rarest collections of books and MSS. which any house can boast. It
would be an endless task, and indeed quite out of place in this work, much
as we desire to linger in the room, to attempt to give even a very brief <i>résumé</i>
of the treasures it contains. We cannot, however, resist the temptation of
saying that here is the famous Anglo-Saxon MS. of Caedmon, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
altogether, perhaps, the most important, and the finest MS. of the period.
The prayer-book of Henry VII. is highly interesting, both historically and
artistically. It is of 8vo size, and consists of 186 leaves of vellum, on several
of which are beautiful miniatures in the most exquisite colouring and design;
many of these designs, as notably, our Saviour in the act of benediction, the
murder of St. Thomas A’Becket, and St. George, are remarkably fine both in
conception and execution. It was given by the king, Henry VII., to his
daughter, Margaret, Queen of Scotland, mother to the Lady Margaret Douglas,
who in turn gave it to the Archbishop of St. Andrew’s. It contains the
following among other touching gift lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Remembre yr kynde and louyng fader in yo<sup>r</sup> good prayers. Henry R.”</p>

<p>“Pray for your loving father that gave you this booke and gave you God’s blessing
and mine.”</p>

<p>“My good Lorde of St. tandrews, I pray you pray for me that gave you thys bouk.
Yours to my powr, Margaret,”</p></div>

<p class="pn1">and many other MSS. The <i>compotus</i> of Bolton Abbey, 1287 to 1385; the “Liber
Veritas” of Claude Lorraine (for which, we believe, no less than £20,000
was at one time offered); a splendid collection of Wynkyn de Worde’s and
Caxton’s printings; a marvellously fine assemblage of early editions;&mdash;altogether,
as rich, as curious, as important, and as valuable a collection of
books as can anywhere be found. We know of no place where we should so
much delight to remain as among the literary treasures in this grand library,
which has for us many hidden charms.</p>

<p>Passing out from this splendid apartment, is the <span class="smcap">Ante-Library</span>, formed of
two exquisitely beautiful little rooms, filled with books of the greatest value
and interest. The ceiling of the first or larger room of these is richly gilt,
and adorned with paintings by Hayter and Charles Landseer. The smaller
apartment is a perfect architectural gem, of apsidal form, the dome supported
by a series of columns and pilasters with Corinthian capitals. In this room
are some remarkably fine vases on pedestals. From the Ante-Library a door
opens on the <span class="smcap">North Staircase</span>, on which are hung a fine full-length portrait
of the late Duke of Devonshire, by Sir Francis Grant; full-length portraits of
the Emperor Nicholas of Russia, and of his Empress; Sir Thomas Lawrence’s
full-length portrait of George IV. in his coronation robes; and a curious old
painting, nearly life-size, of the “Flying Childers,” with the following “certificate”
of the age of the horse;&mdash;“September ye 28, 1719. This is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
certifie that the bay stoned horse his Grace the Duke of Devonshire bought of
me was bred by me, and was five years old last grass, and noe more.
Witness my hand, Leo. Childers.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Fireplace by Westmacott in the Dining-room.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Dining-Room</span> is a large and noble apartment with a slightly “barrel-shaped”
ceiling, divided into hexagonal panels filled with roses and foliated
flowers richly gilt. The doors, at one end opening into the vestibule leading
into the cabinet library, and at the other into the sculpture-gallery, have their
cases of white marble, the entablatures supported on massive Ionic columns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
The room is lit by five windows on its east side, and opposite to these are two
exquisitely beautiful white marble chimney-pieces, each of which has two life-size
statues, two by Westmacott and two by Sievier. Around the room are
six side-tables; two are of hornblende, two of Siberian jasper, and two of
porphyritic sienite. The furniture is massive and appropriate, and the walls
display family portraits, chiefly by Vandyke.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Sculpture Gallery.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sculpture Gallery</span>, one of the “glories” of Chatsworth, is entered
from the dining-room at one end, and at the other opens into the Orangery.
This noble gallery is 103 feet in length and 30 in width, is of proportionate
height, and is lighted from the roof. The walls are of finely-dressed sandstone,
and the door-cases of Derbyshire marble; the entablatures supported by
Corinthian columns and pilasters of various marbles with gilt capitals. Of
the precious treasures contained in this gallery it would be impossible, in the
space we have at our disposal, to speak at length. We shall, therefore,
content ourselves with simply enumerating some of the more prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
sculptures, noting that the pedestals, columns, &amp;c., are all of the most choice
and valuable materials. Among the examples here, and in other parts of the
mansion, so charmingly and effectively arranged, are the following:&mdash;</p>

Many of the busts here named are in the state-rooms, and besides the
sculptures we have enumerated there are many other beautiful examples of
this art in various parts of the house and grounds. From the Sculpture
Gallery&mdash;</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Orangery</span> is entered by a massive doorway between two splendidly
carved colossal lions, after Canova. It is 108 feet in length and 27 in width,
and, beside its myriads of beauties as a conservatory, contains some exceedingly
fine specimens of sculpture. From the centre of the Orangery egress is
had to the grounds, and at its north end a corridor (in which are some pieces
of ancient sculpture and mosaic) leads to the baths and to a staircase which
gives access to the banqueting or ball-room, and the open pavilion. These
are not, of course, shown to the public; but, nevertheless, a few words may
well be added concerning them.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ball-room</span>, or <span class="smcap">Banqueting-room</span>, as it is sometimes called, is a magnificent
apartment, 81 feet long by 30 in width, and very lofty. The ceiling
is divided into compartments, each of which contains a beautiful painting set
in richly-gilt framing; the whole of the intermediate parts being painted in
fresco, with medallions of crest and coronet and monogram of the Duke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Prominent among the subjects on the ceiling are Sir James Thornhill’s
“Perseus and Andromeda,” paintings by Louis Charon, and a view of
Chatsworth, with allegorical figures in the front. Over this room is the open
<span class="smcap">Pavilion</span>, from which extensive and charming views of the surrounding
country are obtained.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Pavilion and Orangery, from the East.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The lower, or <span class="smcap">Basement Story</span>, remains to be noticed. This, like the
other stories we have described, runs round the four sides of the quadrangle
of the main building; the basement of the north wing being devoted to the
kitchens and domestic and business offices. The grand staircase occupies the
inner south-east angle, the grand hall and various private apartments taking
up the east side. On the north is the entrance, the sub-hall, the north
corridor, and various private apartments. The west front is occupied by the
Duke’s private suite of rooms, the Marquis of Hartington’s private rooms, the
west entrance, the west staircase, and corridor. The south side comprises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
the south corridor, the Chapel at the south-west corner, the Oak Room, the
south entrance, the Stag Parlour, and other apartments. It will only be our
province on this story (having already described the sub-hall, north corridor,
and grand hall), to speak of the corridors, the Chapel, and cursorily of one or
two other of the apartments on this floor. Passing beneath the grand staircase
in the great hall is the “<span class="smcap">Grotto Room</span>,” the ceiling of which, supported
by four massive pillars and twelve pilasters, is divided into compartments;
some of them being enriched by the <i>insignia</i> of the Order of the Garter.
Opposite the entrance is a boldly and powerfully sculptured fountain-piece,
the central subject of which is Venus at the Bath; the accessories being
dolphins, crabs, lobsters, fish, and other appropriate objects. To the east of
this room is an ante-room giving access to the south-east sitting-room
(a charming apartment filled with interesting pictures and other works of art),
and to the apartments on the east, as well as to the grounds. On the west
is the <span class="smcap">South Corridor</span>, from which doors open into the various rooms on this
side. In this corridor are several curious old paintings, and it is further
adorned with bronzes and some splendidly-carved antique coffers. In the
centre of this corridor a door opens into the <span class="smcap">Oak Room</span>, and, although this is
not shown to visitors, it is so truly and strikingly beautiful that we cannot
resist the temptation of just alluding to it. This was formerly the “Chaplain’s
Room,” but by the good taste of its late noble owner was altered and made
what it certainly now is, one of the gems of the house. It is lined on all
sides with the most magnificent old oak carving of panels, figures, busts, &amp;c.;
and the ceiling is supported by four majestic twisted oak pillars, with composite
capitals, carved in foliage, and reminding one forcibly of Raffaelle’s
celebrated cartoon. The entablature is heraldic: it is composed of thirty
shields of arms, emblazoned in their proper colours. The lower part of the
“wooden walls” are arranged as book-cases, and above these the panels are
doubly filled with a series of beautiful landscapes and sea-pieces, by Carmichael.
The centre of the floor, within the oak piers, is of oak parqueterie;
the remainder is filled with tiles, in imitation of tesselated pavement. Adjoining
this room is the Chapel.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chapel</span> at Chatsworth, which occupies the south-west angle of the
mansion, is perhaps the most striking and peculiar to be seen in any of the
“stately homes” of our country. Its arrangement also&mdash;for its altar is at
the <i>west</i> end&mdash;is somewhat unusual, and its decorations are of the most
exquisitely beautiful character. This elegant chapel is 47 feet 4 inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
length by 23 feet 10 inches in width, and in height it occupies two entire
stories, reaching from the ground-floor up to the floor of the upper, or state-room,
story. At its east end, midway in height, and communicating with the
gallery of paintings and with the billiard-room, is a gallery supported upon
two massive pillars of black marble, with white marble capitals and bases.
The chapel is lighted by three windows on the upper story. The floor is
paved with marble, and the altar-piece is also of marble; the pillar and steps
of black, and the remainder of white marble. On the sides are two fine
figures of Faith and Hope, by Caius Gabriel Cibber (father of Colley Cibber),
who was much employed at Chatsworth from 1688 to 1690, or thereabouts,
and who, besides these marble figures, carved two large Sphinxes, statues
of Pallas, Apollo, a Triton, and other figures. The top of the altar-piece
is exquisitely sculptured with cherubs and festoons, and at the sides are
vases of flowers. In the lower pediment or recess is a dove, and there are
also some charming figures of cherubs, &amp;c.; under the recess is a most chaste
and beautiful bust of our Saviour.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>The chapel is wainscoted throughout in its lower story with cedar, which,
besides its beautiful rich colour, gives a peculiar yet very grateful odour to
the place, and accords well with the subdued light and its general effect.
The reading-desk also is of cedar. The ceiling and the upper story of the
apartment are painted in the same remarkably fine manner as those of the
state-rooms, by Verrio and Laguerre; the subjects being, “The Incredibility
of St. Thomas,” “Christ and the Woman of Samaria,” “Christ Healing the
Blind,” and the “Ascension of our Saviour.” There are, also, figures of the
Christian attributes, Justice, Mercy, Charity, and Liberality.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Carving over one of the Doors of the Chapel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The great glory, artistically, however, of the Chapel at Chatsworth, and,
indeed, as we have already said, of the state-rooms of this noble pile, are the
splendid wood-carvings which adorn its walls and the heads of its upper
doors. Between the large panels of the cedar walls are exquisite pendants,
ten in number, and others occur on each side of the altar. The pendants
consist of flowers, fruit, foliage, and corn, festooned and entwined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
drapery in the most free and graceful manner, and so true to nature in every
detail as to be deceptive. Over the doors in the gallery are fine figures of
Cupids with musical instruments. These, and some of the pendants, we
engrave.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>And now it becomes necessary to say a word or two as to the authors of
these and the other exquisite carvings which adorn the rooms of Chatsworth.
Those in the chapel, as well as some others, are generally believed and
generally stated to be by Grinling Gibbons; and if marvellous skill in
execution, masterly conception, delicate handling, and purity of design, be any
special characteristic of the work of that great genius, then, most assuredly,
there is sufficient in these examples to lead the most able judges to appropriate
them to him; judgment, however, and popular belief must not be allowed to
usurp the place of facts, and it is an undoubted fact that in the accounts of
the building of Chatsworth, although the names of all the more noted artists
and contractors appear, that of Grinling Gibbons does not, it is stated, once
occur; still it is possible that work might have been done by him, and it is
conjectured that as the sum of £14 15<i>s.</i> was paid to Henry Lobb, the carpenter,
for cases in which some <i>carved work</i>, statues, and pictures, were
conveyed to Chatsworth from London, this carved work <i>might</i> be by
Gibbons.</p>

<p>The principal wood-carvers were Thomas Young, William Davies, Joel
Lobb, and Samuel Watson, to the latter of whom is undoubtedly due the
credit of much of the work which has of late been ascribed to Gibbons.
Those who have admired the exquisite carving of flowers, dead game, fish,
nets, festoons, &amp;c., in the State Dining-room, to which we have alluded, and
have considered them to be by the master-hand of Gibbons, will perhaps learn,
with some little surprise, that they are the creations of the genius of Watson
(a Derbyshire worthy), and his co-labourers, Lobb and Davies. The following
is the memorandum relating to the agreement as to this work, contained in
the original book of work done by Watson from 1690 to 1712. “Sept. 9,
1692. Joel Lobb, William Davies, and Samuel Watson agreed with the Earl
of Devonshire to execute in lime-tree, the carving of the great chamber, to be
done equal to anything of the kind before executed, for which they were to
receive £400; this carving consists of flowers, wreaths, dead game, cherubs,” &amp;c.
The original designs by Watson for some of the carving in this room (as well
as in others) are preserved.</p>

<p>Samuel Watson was born at Heanor, in Derbyshire, in 1662, and is said
to have studied under&mdash;indeed to have been an apprentice of&mdash;C. Oakley, in
London. Soon after completing his apprenticeship he commenced work at
Chatsworth, and here he continued to be employed, as the accounts show,
until 1712, only three years before his death, which took place in 1715. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
was buried at his native village, Heanor, where a tablet remains to his
memory, bearing the following verse:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Watson is gone, whose skilful Art display’d<br />
To the very life whatever Nature made;<br />
View but his wondrous works in Chatsworth hall,<br />
Which are so gazed at and admired of all<br />
You’ll say ‘tis pity he should hidden lie,<br />
And nothing said to revive his memory.<br />
My mournful friends, forbear your tears,<br />
For I shall rise when Christ appears.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“This <span class="smcap">Samuel Watson</span> died 29th March, 1715, aged 53 years.”</p>

<p class="p1">There is nothing, so far as we are aware, to show by whom the carvings
in the chapel were executed, but they have been pronounced by competent
judges, and by no less an authority in late years than Mr. Rogers, to be the
work of Gibbons. The probability is they are by him, and it is also equally
probable that he was the presiding genius of the place, supplying designs, and,
besides working himself, directing the labours of others. We regret that
space will not admit of our speaking at greater length upon this tempting and
fascinating subject; but, giving one or two engravings of portions of the
carvings,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> we must now pass on to say a few words concerning the exquisite
modern decorations of the private library and rooms adjoining.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">West Library</span> and the <span class="smcap">Leather Room</span> are, without exception, the
most purely elegant and chaste in their fittings and decorations of any apartments
we know, and nothing could possibly exceed the purity of taste displayed
in them. The ceiling of the Library is delicately frescoed in arabesque
foliage, and groups of figures in rich colours, and the spaces between the
book-presses are similarly decorated. Among the decorations of the ceiling
are several beautifully painted medallion-heads of Virgilius Maro, Marcus
Tullius Cicero, Horatius Flaccus, Titus Livius, and others: over the book-cases
are also medallion-portraits, supported by figures and foliage, of famous
poets, with appropriate sentiments: thus, over Shakspeare occurs “Exhausted
worlds and then imagined new;” over Milton, “A Poet blind yet bold;”
Byron, “The wandering outlaw of his own brave land;” Scott, “The Ariosto
of the North;” Chaucer, “Well of English undefiled;” Thomson, “As
Nature various, and as Art complete,” and so on. The doors of this and the
adjoining room are so arranged with imitation book-backs, that, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
are closed, it is impossible to see any means of egress or ingress. The books
on these doors (like those in the Great Library) have fictitious names, many
of which, written by Hood, although perhaps not in good keeping with the
excellent taste of the rest of the fittings, are extremely amusing, and worthy
of his inimitable vein of humour. Of these it is difficult to resist giving an
example or two. Here they are:&mdash;“Horn Took on Catching Cows;”
“Wren’s Voyage to the Canaries;” “Dyspepsia and Heartburn, by the
Bishop of Sodor;” “Dibdin’s Cream of Tar;” “Minto’s Coins;” “Merry’s
Gay;” “Esterhazy on Spring Fogs;” “Inigo Jones on Secret Entrances;”
“Hyde upon Wood;” “Macadam’s Rhodes;” “Egg, by Shelley;” “Skye,
by McCloud;” “Bramah’s Rape of the Lock;” “Beveridge on the Beer
Act;” “D. Cline on Consumption,” and many others.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>The “Leather Room” has its walls and ceiling formed entirely of embossed
leather richly gilt; the ceiling heightened in medallions with blue
ground and relief-painted figures, and with richly decorated pendants.
Adjoining these rooms is the West Entrance, the floor of which is of mosaic,
and the ceiling bears an allegorical painting of the Arts; in the centre is
Architecture, holding a drawing of the west front of Chatsworth, crowned by
Fame, and beneath are Cupids with plan of Chatsworth, and compasses, &amp;c.
In the coving are Cupids, and on the walls hang some interesting pictures.</p>

<p>In the West Corridor are preserved some highly-interesting Roman
inscribed sepulchral stones, and other sculptures. One of these is inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="limit2">
<p class="pi0q p1">“DIS MANIBVS<br />

<p class="p1">In the West Lodge, at the entrance gates, are also preserved many fragments
of ancient sculpture, and a portion of a Roman tesselated pavement
with <i>guilloche</i> pattern and other borders. Among the sculptures is a marble
cinerary urn bearing the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn1">Another cinerary urn is inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">“D M<br />

<p class="pn1">There are also other portions of inscriptions, and among the more interesting
of these remains are:&mdash;A fine <i>torso</i> of Venus, and another <i>torso</i> of a female, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
very similar dimensions; the head of a stag, life-size, presented to the
Duchess of Devonshire by the King of Naples; heads of fawns, of Jupiter, of
a Cupid, of Silenus, &amp;c.; part of a colossal medallion of Lucius Verus; a
bas-relief of Bacchus, supported by a younger male figure; an <i>alto-relievo</i> of
a procession of Silenus, in which that god is shown seated on a chariot, and
leaning on a young Bacchante, and a fawn is playing on the double pipe; a
number of architectural ornaments; some fine masks and portions of masks;
an <i>alto-relievo</i> of three female figures and the dog Cerberus; a fragment
representing Diana and Actæon; two right hands, one grasping the other
firmly, as if struggling in wrestling or fighting; some Egyptian figures, &amp;c.,
and many other fragments.</p>

<p>The gardens and grounds of Chatsworth are marvels of beauty, and are,
indeed, in many respects, matchless both for their picturesqueness, their
elegance, and the skill with which they have been laid out. Leaving the
mansion from the door of the Orangery, to the left is a spacious alcove, and
to the right, running in a direct line
for more than a quarter of a mile in
length, is a broad gravel path, at the
summit of which, beneath a lofty
avenue of trees, is seen a gigantic
vase, bearing the simple name of
“Blanche,” in touching memory of
the much-loved and accomplished
Lady Blanche Georgiana Howard,
the wife of the present Duke of
Devonshire.</p>

<p>From this spot the view
on all sides is truly grand (embracing
the mansion, the gardens, the lakes,
basins and fountains, the woods and
shrubberies, the park and the river,
and the distant country towards
Rowsley), and paths lead in various
directions among the beauties of the
place: here a delightful little dell or
a fernery where ferns and heaths grow
in wild profusion, there another dell of rhododendrons, or with statuary
among heathery banks and masses of rock. Near here, too, is a sylvan slope,
headed by a gigantic bronze bust of the late Duke, mounted on a pillar, composed
of fragments of an ancient Greek fluted column from the Temple of
Minerva at Sunium. On the base are these beautiful verses by Lord Carlisle:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“These fragments stood on Sunium’s airy steep;<br />
They reared aloft Minerva’s guardian shrine;<br />
Beneath them rolled the blue Egean deep;<br />
And the Greek pilot hail’d them as divine.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Such was, e’en then, their look of calm repose.<br />
As wafted round them came the sounds of fight,<br />
When the glad shouts of conquering Athens rose<br />
O’er the long track of Persia’s broken flight.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Tho’ clasped by prostrate worshippers no more,<br />
They yet shall breathe a thrilling lesson here;<br />
Tho’ distant from their own immortal shore,<br />
The spot they grace is still to freedom dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Of this classic pedestal, with its crowning bust, we give an engraving on the
preceding page.</p>

<p>Opposite to the Orangery is the <span class="smcap">French Garden</span>, with its forest of pillars
surmounted by busts, its grand old Egyptian figures, its Chinese beakers and
vases, its sculptured figures and groups, and its raised parterres: near this
are green-houses, conservatories, and camelia and orchid houses, with their
endless store of beauties; while here and there an antique tomb, or sculptured
figures, or groups of statuary, add their charms to the place.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The French Garden.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From above this part of the gardens a broad path to the right leads on to
the Great Conservatory, passing on its way the Cascade, the Willow Tree, and
other interesting spots. The Grand Cascade, of which we give an engraving,
the Willow Tree, and other parts of the artificial water-works, were designed
and executed, as already stated, in the early part of last century, by M. Grillet,
and added to and repaired by the late Duke, under the direction of Sir
J. Paxton. The water supplying the Great Cascade, the fountains, and the
other portions of the works, falls, as will be seen in our engraving, from the
summit of the wooded heights at the back of the grounds, and is then conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
along a lofty arched aqueduct, from the end of which it falls with
considerable force, and is then carried underground to the temple, at the head
of the cascade. Here it rises to the domed roof of the temple, which becomes
a sheet of water, and, rushing through the various carved channels prepared
for it in the groups of figures, &amp;c., makes its way down the cascade, formed
of a long series of stone steps with flats at regular intervals, and at the bottom
sinks into a subterranean channel at the spectator’s feet.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Great Cascade.</i></p>

<p>The Temple, which is open, is of circular form in its interior, with recess
and niches with stone seats, the niches enriched with carved shell-heads and festoons
of flowers. Externally, an open temple supported on six pillars surmounts
the dome. In front, over the central arch, is a powerfully-carved recumbent
figure of Neptune holding an urn; below him, on either side, is an immense
dolphin, with head downwards; and on the sides are water-nymphs with vases.
On either side the open archway is a gigantic dolphin’s head, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
base are dragons. From the whole of these figures and heads the water rushes
out, and, simultaneously, two beautiful fountains rise in front of the temple.</p>

design, which forms a beautiful retreat, at a bend in the drive, with a pleasant
little rill running down near it. The front of the alcove is formed of two
horse-shoe shaped arches supported on granite pillars, the spandrels carved
with monograms; on the ceiling are the Cavendish arms and motto twice
repeated. On the wall inside are two tablets, one bearing the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Won from the brow of yonder headlong hill,<br />
Through grassy channels, see the sparkling rill<br />
O’er the chafed pebbles, in its murmuring flow,<br />
Sheds freshness on the thirsty vale below,<br />
Quick’ning the ground till trees of every zone<br />
In Chatsworth’s soil and clime, forget their own.”</p>

<p class="pr8">H. L. Sept. <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCCXXXIX</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">On the other is this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Ecce, supercilio clivosi tramitis undam<br />
Elicit: illa cadens raucum per levia murmur<br />
Saxa ciet, scatebrisque arentia temperat arva.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Waterworks&mdash;The Willow Tree.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Willow-tree</span>, one of the most striking and clever of the water-works,
is a weeping willow, about twenty feet in height, entirely formed of copper and
lead, and coloured in imitation of a real tree. It stands in a charming little
circular dell, overhung with forest-trees, and surrounded by banks and
rockeries covered with luxuriant ferns and other plants, itself rising from a
central rock-work, around which runs a path. At the entrance to this little
dell are a vase and fountain, and at the opposite side is a leaden statue of Pan,
holding in his hand the Pandean pipes, and having a goat at his feet. From
each leaf and stem of this remarkable tree, the water, when turned on from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
small hidden cave in the rock in front, rushes out in a rapid stream, and
thus forms a novel kind of “shower-bath” to any luckless visitor who may
happen to be beneath it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>Part of the Rock-work.</i></p>
</div>

<p>At the same time, a number of jets rise up from
hidden pipes all around the dell, and these streams being directed angularly
upwards towards the centre, while those from the tree fall in all directions
downwards, there is no way of escape without being caught in the heavy
shower. Of this tree we give an engraving from a photograph taken specially
for the purpose, with others of our illustrations, by Mr. George Green, of
Worthing, an eminent photographic artist, whom we specially engaged for
these Chatsworth views, and whose skill deserves high commendation. Near
the Willow-tree, passing onwards towards the grand conservatory, is a rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
archway of wondrous construction, and a little beyond this a “rocky portal”&mdash;an
immense block of unhewn stone, turning upon an axis with such ease as
to be moved with the pressure of a single finger.</p>

<p>Passing through this portal, one of the next most striking objects is a
perpendicular rock, of great altitude, down whose face a stream of water is
for ever falling, and this water supplies some charming little lakes filled with
aquatic plants, in whose windings and intricacies the botanist and lover of
nature might revel for hours.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Great Conservatory.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Great Conservatory</span>, one of the wonders of Chatsworth, besides its
own attraction as the finest conservatory in the kingdom, possesses an historical
interest as being the first of its kind ever erected, and from which the
idea of the Great Exhibition building of 1851, and all the later exhibition
buildings, including the “Crystal Palace” at Sydenham, was taken. This
splendid conservatory was erected some years ago by Sir Joseph, at that time
Mr., Paxton, and is, in its interior, 277 feet in length, 123 feet in width, and
no fewer than 67 feet in height in its centre. Its form is that of a trefoil;
the transverse section showing a semicircle 70 feet in diameter, rising from
two segments of circles springing from breast-walls. The whole building is
of glass, constructed on the “ridge and furrow” principle, with iron ribs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
About 70,000 square feet of glass are used in this gigantic building, and the
iron sash ribs alone are calculated to extend, if laid together lengthways, no
less than forty miles. At each end is a large doorway, and along the centre
is a wide carriage-drive, so that several carriages can, on any special occasion,
as on the Queen’s visit in 1843, be within the building at the same time.
Besides the central drive, there are side-aisles running the entire length,
and a cross-aisle in the centre of the building. A light and elegant gallery
also runs round the entire interior, and is approached by a staircase hidden
among the rockery. Of the collection of trees and plants preserved in this
giant conservatory, it is not necessary to speak further than to say that from
the smallest aquatic plants up to the most stately palm-trees, and from the
banana down to the papyrus and the delicate ferns, every conceivable rarity
and beauty is here, flourishing in native luxuriance and in endless profusion.
Beneath the conservatory a railway runs around the entire building, for fuel
and other purposes.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Part of the Rock-work&mdash;the Rocky Portal.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Not far from the conservatory, and approached by a path between tall and
stately yew hedges, is a sweetly pretty circular pool of water, with central
fountain, filled with water-lilies, and surrounded first by a broad circular band
of grass, then by a broad encircling gravel-path, edged on half its circumference
with a closely-cut yew hedge with arched entrances, and the other half
planted at regular intervals with cypress-trees. This, however, is but one of
many charming spots which characterize the grounds at Chatsworth.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Emperor Fountain.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Emperor Fountain</span> is one of the great attractions of Chatsworth, and
one that to see is to remember. This marvellous fountain throws up a thick
jet of water no fewer than 267 feet in height, which, spreading out as it
falls, forms a liquid sheet of spray, on which, not unfrequently, the sunlight
produces an exquisite rainbow. The quantity of metal, we are told, required
in the formation of the pipes, &amp;c., for this gigantic work, amounts to nearly
220 tons. The force of the water is so great that it is said to rush out of
the pipe at the rate of a hundred miles a minute. Near the “Emperor” are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
other fountains of great beauty, and when all are playing, the effect is beyond
description.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Garden on the West Front.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Of the truly elegant and indeed wondrous gardens and parterres on the
west and south fronts of the mansion, and of the thousand and one other
attractions of the place, we have not time to speak, so lengthy has our article
upon this “Palace of the Peak” already become; but there are yet two
or three objects before passing out into the outer grounds and the kitchen-garden
&amp;c., on which we must say a word. These are the trees that were
planted by royalty, and which most loyally have been tended, and grown up to
a wondrous size. One of these is an oak-tree planted (well do we remember
the circumstance, and the pretty, simple, earnest, and interesting appearance
of the youthful princess at the time) in 1832, by our present beloved Queen,
when, as a child of thirteen, then the “Princess Victoria,” she visited Chatsworth,
with her august mother the Duchess of Kent. This tree, which in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
forty years’ growth has become a stately oak, bears the label,&mdash;“This Oak
planted by Princess Victoria, October 11th, 1832.” Near it is a Spanish
chestnut thus labelled&mdash;“Spanish chestnut, planted by the Duchess of Kent,
October 17th, 1832.” Then comes a sycamore planted when the Queen and
the Prince Consort, “Albert the Good,” visited Chatsworth in 1843; it is
labelled&mdash;“This Sycamore planted by Prince Albert, 1843.” In another part
of the garden, opposite the west front, are a “Sweet Chestnut, planted by the
(late) Emperor of Russia, 1816;” and a “Variegated Sycamore, planted by
the Archduke Michael of Russia, 1818.” A tree was also planted by H. R. H.
the Prince of Wales, on the visit of himself and H. R. H. the Princess of
Wales, to Chatsworth, in December, 1872.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>West Front from the South.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Chatsworth Park and grounds, from the Baslow Lodge on the north to
Edensor Mill Lodge on the south, and from the East Moor on the east to
Holme Wood on the west, are somewhere about ten miles in circumference,
and comprise an area, in round numbers, of about 1,200 acres; and it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
be difficult to find anywhere, in the same space, so great a variety of scenery
ranging from the purely sylvan to the wildly romantic, and from the luxuriant
wood to the rugged and barren rock, where beauties of one kind or other
crowd together so thickly, or where such a charming alternation from one
phase to another exists. But it is impossible even briefly to attempt to speak
of these beauties&mdash;our engravings will have shown some of their features;
others must be left for the eye of the visitor to revel in while there. On one
or two more points only can we touch.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Hunting Tower.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Hunting Tower</span>, which forms so conspicuous an object in the landscape,
crowning the wooded heights at the back of the house, and from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
floats a huge flag whenever the Duke is at Chatsworth, was built in the reign
of Queen Elizabeth as a prospect-tower, from which the ladies of the family,
and guests, might watch the progress of the chase. It is a massive erection,
of square form, with a circular turret at each angle, and is about ninety feet in
height; it commands a magnificent prospect on every side. Near it, by the
lake, or reservoir, is the <span class="smcap">Swiss Cottage</span>&mdash;a perfect cottage ornée.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Mary Queen of Scots’ Bower.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Queen Mary’s Bower</span> is one of the best-known objects in the park, being
situated near the drive leading from the bridge to the house, and at a short
distance only from the banks of the river Derwent. This interesting relic of
the unfortunate queen is a raised enclosure surrounded by a deep moat, and
approached by a flight of steps which bridge over the water on its south side.
Externally the “bower,” overhung with trees and covered here and there
with ivy which reaches up to its open balustrade, is highly picturesque; internally
it is a pleasant enclosed grassy retreat, rendered shady by the trees
which grow in and around it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Kitchen Gardens</span> lie to the left of the drive from the house to
Baslow, and near to the banks of the Derwent. They are of great extent,
and of the most perfectly scientific character in the arrangements&mdash;indeed, it
would be impossible to find finer or better constructed gardens attached to
any mansion. At the entrance to the gardens, shortly after passing through
the lodge, is the house formerly inhabited by the late Sir Joseph Paxton, M.P.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
who was head gardener to the late Duke of Devonshire. This house,
originally a fit dwelling-place for the head gardener of such a grand establishment
as Chatsworth, but which had “grown with the greatness” of Sir
Joseph until it became in itself an elegant mansion, is now very properly
altered and divided into two residences. Sir Joseph Paxton, whose career
was marked with great success, was born at Milton Bryant, in Bedfordshire,
on the 3rd of August, 1803, his
father, a small farmer, being a
tenant of the Duke of Bedford.</p>

<div class="floatleft">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Late Sir Joseph Paxton’s House.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Sir Joseph was brought up to be a
gardener, and was, when quite a
boy, taken under the care of his
elder brother, at that time head
gardener at Wimbledon House.
When a little more than twenty
years of age he was placed in the
Horticultural Gardens at Chiswick,
and, being quick and clever, he had
the charge of a plant-range committed
to his care. These grounds
joined those of the Duke of Devonshire’s
seat, Chiswick House, and
his grace, finding young Paxton
attentive and intelligent, took much
notice of him. The result was that
his grace, a short time before leaving
England as Ambassador to Russia,
made an engagement with him. In
May, 1826, shortly after the Duke’s
return, Paxton entered upon his
new duties as head gardener at
Chatsworth, being at that time about twenty-three years of age. In the
following year he married Miss Sarah Bown, and soon after was made forester,
and next, manager, of the parks, and of the game department, and was
consulted by his noble employer upon most subjects connected with the
household and estates, and ultimately, he added to his already important
offices that of agent for the home district of Chatsworth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1831, Mr. Paxton, in conjunction with Mr. Harrison, commenced the
publication of “The Horticultural Register.” Other works followed, including
his “Magazine of Botany,” a “Practical Treatise on the Culture of the
Dahlia,” a “Pocket Botanical Dictionary,” the “Flower Garden,” and others,
and these will undoubtedly remain standard works. During the whole of
this time, and to the time of the death of the duke, Mr. Paxton’s mind
was actively engaged, and his energy constantly employed, in the improvement
of the gardens and grounds at Chatsworth, and the erection of
the grand conservatory and other plant-houses, &amp;c. In 1851 he brought his
talents to bear in a national matter&mdash;the designing and erecting of the Great
Exhibition building of that year, taking as his model the conservatory which,
on his own design in every particular, he had a few years before erected.
In the same year he was knighted by the Queen, at Windsor, on the 23rd of
October, and in 1854 was elected M.P. for the City of Coventry. Sir Joseph
Paxton designed the present Crystal Palace, and it is not too much to say
that to his principle of glass buildings, of a wide span, and glazed on the
ridge-and-furrow principle (invented by him), there is scarcely a railway-station,
conservatory, or large public hall or pavilion, that does not trace its
origin. Sir Joseph died in 1865, and Lady Paxton in 1871.</p>

<p>Of the interior of the <span class="smcap">Victoria Regia House</span> we give an engraving,
showing the gigantic leaf and flower of this royal plant, which was first
grown, and first flowered, at Chatsworth, and named after our beloved
Queen, to whom the first flower was presented in 1849. Besides the
“Victoria Regia House,” other points of interest in the kitchen gardens are
the “New Holland House,” the “Amherstia House,” the “Pine Houses”
and the “Vineries.” The kitchen gardens are not, of course, open to
visitors.</p>

<p>The village of <span class="smcap">Edensor</span>, closely adjoining the park, was, with the
exception of the church and one or two houses, removed to its present
position from its former site in the park some forty years ago. It is, indeed,
the most perfect model village we have ever seen, and the beauty of its
villas&mdash;for every cottage in the place <i>is</i> a villa&mdash;the charm of its scenery, and
the peace and quietness which seem to reign in and around it, make it as near
an <i>Eden</i> on earth as one can expect any place to be, and to which its name
most curiously and appropriately points. Edensor is entered by a very
picturesque lodge from the park, and the outlet at its upper extremity is also
closed by gates, so that the only thoroughfare through the place is a highway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
to Bakewell. Besides the Agent’s house, there are in Edensor a good parsonage
house and a village school, but, luckily, there is neither a village
ale-house, blacksmith’s forge, wheelwright’s shop, or any other gossiping
place; and unpleasant sights and discordant sounds are alike unknown.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Victoria Regia.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The old church of Edensor was taken down a few years ago, and the
present one, from the design of Gilbert Scott, erected on its site by his grace
the present Duke of Devonshire. The old church consisted of a nave with
side aisles and a chancel, and it had a square battlemented tower at its west
end. The nave and western porch were also battlemented; the battlements
being carried over the gable of the chancel-arch, in the centre of which was a
niche for a sanctus-bell. The east window was of decorative character, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
were those at the east end of the south aisle, and one near the priests’ door
on the south side of the chancel. Interiorly the church possessed many
interesting features, including some remarkable capitals, which have mostly
been preserved, with the curious monuments, in the new edifice.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Edensor Church and Village.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The present church, completed in 1870, is a remarkably fine and elegant
structure, with a lofty tower and broach spire at its west end; of it we give
an engraving, as seen from the upper part of the village, from a photograph
by Mr. E. F. Bampton, of Edensor. It consists of a nave with side aisles, a
chancel, and a monumental chapel opening from the south side of the chancel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
The font, which is of marble, and extremely chaste and beautiful, is at the
west end, and the pulpit, which also is of marble, is placed against the
chancel-arch. In the chancel are very elegant <i>sedilia</i>, and the floor is laid
with encaustic tiles. One of the most historically interesting remains in this
church is a brass plate in the chancel to the memory of John Beton, one of
the household and confidential servants of Mary Queen of Scots, who died at
Chatsworth while his royal mistress was a captive there, in 1570. At the
head of the plate are the arms of Beton (who was of the same family as
Cardinal David Beton, who took so prominent a part in the affairs of Scotland
in the reign of James V. and of Mary, and of James Beton, Archbishop of
St. Andrew’s), quarterly first and fourth a fesse between three mascles;
second and third, on a chevron an otter’s head, erased; with the crest a
talbot’s head. At the bottom is a figure of Beton, in plate armour, lying dead
upon a pallet, his hands by his side and his head resting on a pillow. Of this
historically interesting brass we give a careful engraving on the opposite page.
For this, with some other illustrations, we are indebted to “The Reliquary,
Archæological Journal.”</p>

<p>Another brass plate, near the chancel-arch, bears the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Here lies ye Body of Mr. Iohn Philips,<br />

<p class="pr8 reduct">Amen.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the chapel alluded to is a large and remarkably fine monument, entirely
filling up its west side, and of somewhat remarkable character. On either
side is a massive pedestal, supporting a life-size statue, and pilasters which
rise behind them support a pediment for the sculptured arms, crest, and
supporters of the Earl of Devonshire.</p>

<p>In the churchyard are many interesting inscriptions, which the visitor may
well while away an hour or two in examining. Here, in a grassy enclosure at
the top of the churchyard, too, lies the “good duke,” under a plain and
simple coped tomb, with a foliated cross, and this simple inscription on its

<p class="pp8q p1">“William Spencer Cavendish,<br />

<p class="pbq p1">“Henry George Cavendish. Born May 24, 1836. Died November 9, 1865.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the churchyard is the heavy tomb of Sir Joseph Paxton, sometime
head gardener at Chatsworth; it bears the following inscriptions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“In memory of Sir Joseph Paxton, born at Milton Bryant, Bedfordshire, August <span class="smcap lowercase">III</span>rd,

<p class="p1">Among the other inscriptions, the following are particularly worth
noticing:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp16q p1">“Of Stature Great,<br />

<p class="p1">The <span class="smcap">Chatsworth Hotel</span>, at Edensor&mdash;the only one in the place&mdash;is
situate close outside the park gates, with an open space of ground in front,
and surrounded by the most magnificent of trees and the most beautiful of
scenery. It is fitted with every appliance for comfort; has an excellent
<i>cuisine</i>; is liberally and well conducted; has every possible convenience of
stabling and coach-houses; and is, altogether, one of the most desirable and
comfortable of hotels.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Chatsworth Hotel, Edensor.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From this house, which is an excellent centre for
tourists, for enjoying the neighbourhood, and who have the magnificent park
to stroll about in at all hours, delightful excursions may be made to places in
the neighbourhood. Chatsworth is at hand; Haddon Hall is only some three
miles away for a walk, or six for a delightful drive, round by way of Bakewell;
Monsall Dale, Cressbrook Dale, Middleton Dale, and a host of other “dales”
are all within a short distance; and, indeed, a radius of ten miles from the
hotel takes in almost every well-known beautiful or romantic spot of the
district; while Buxton, with its many attractions, and Dove-Dale, with all its
beauties, are only a little beyond this distance. It is, indeed, a district to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
revel in, and the tourist who “pitches his tent” at the Chatsworth Hotel will
be conveniently placed for access to all.</p>

<p>We have spoken of Edensor, which closely adjoins one of the entrances to
Chatsworth Park. Near the other lodges are the picturesque villages of
Baslow and Beeley, to which we must pay passing attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baslow</span> is a large and somewhat picturesque village; it lies on the high
road from Bakewell to Chesterfield, Sheffield, &amp;c., and the river Derwent runs
through one part of it. The churchyard is skirted by the river, and near it is
a fine old bridge spanning the stream. The church is a singular, but very
picturesque old building, with a low tower and broad spire at its north-west
corner, and it possesses many features worthy of careful examination. At
Baslow are some very good inns, the principal of which are the “Peacock”
and the “Wheatsheaf.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beeley</span>, which the visitor will pass through on his way to Chatsworth
from the Rowsley Station, is a pretty little village, with a quaint-looking old
church, an elegant Gothic parsonage-house, and many very pretty residences.
Beeley Bridge, with the public lodge near it, we have shown in one of our
engravings, from a photograph by Green. Of other places in the neighbourhood,
some of which we have already touched upon in our account of Haddon
Hall, space will not permit us to describe.</p>

<p>We take leave of “princely Chatsworth.” It is a place worthy of all that
can be said in its praise; and to its noble owner&mdash;one of the kindliest, most
enlightened, and liberal men of the age&mdash;we tender, not only our own, but
public thanks for the generous manner in which he throws its beauties and its
treasures open to the people.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">The</span> noble mansions which have been chosen to form the second series
of our “Stately Homes of England” will, it gives us pleasure to know,
be found to fully bear out what was said in the Introduction to the first
volume, that England is emphatically a Kingdom of Homes, and that
these and their associations, and the love which is felt for them, are its
main source of happiness and true greatness. For assuredly those
we have now selected, like those already illustrated, are noble in their
plans, their proportions, and their architecture; stately and magnificent
in their appointments and internal arrangements; stirring in the
historical incidents with which they have been connected; interesting
from the grand old families by whom they have been, and are still,
inhabited; and more than passingly interesting from their antiquarian
character, their architectural features, their romantic beauties, their
picturesque surroundings, and the invaluable treasures of Art enshrined
within their walls. No matter in what Shire they are situated&mdash;and
we have selected them alike from east and west, from north and south,
as well as from the “lovely midlands”&mdash;these “Homes” serve but as
examples of innumerable others that, dotted over the surface of the
country, form the glory of England, and, through their noble owners,
add to the stability, the greatness, and the proud supremacy of</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Our own, our native land.”</p>

<p class="p1">England has, indeed, reason to be proud of her Homes, and it has
been a pleasant and a loving task to describe and to illustrate some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mvi" id="Page_mvi">[vi]</a></span>
them in these volumes; to give records of the historical incidents with
which they have been associated; and to add the ample genealogical
notices of the families to whom they belong.</p>

<p>Like those in the first volume, these notices were prepared for,
and originally appeared in, the <i>Art Journal</i>, but they have been
rearranged, here and there rewritten, and in every case materially
added to. We shall hope to follow up the present volume&mdash;the second
of the series&mdash;with two or three more of a similar character, in which
other houses, equally beautiful, equally interesting, and equally
“stately” with those we have described, will form the theme of our
pen and the subject of our pencil.</p>

<p class="dc19">ONE of the most majestic
in character, commanding
in situation, picturesque in
surroundings, and striking
in its arrangements, of
all the “Stately Homes
of England,” is Belvoir
Castle, the grand old seat
of his Grace the Duke of
Rutland. Stately among
the stateliest, and standing
on an eminence in the
midst of an undulating
country, the one object on
which the eye rests from
whichever side it is approached,
the castle commands
uninterrupted views
ranging over three separate
counties, and embracing
within its ken such a
variety of plain and water,
wood and valley, hill and meadow, as no other “Home” can boast.
Situated nearly at the junction of the three counties of Leicester, Nottingham,
and Lincoln, the panoramic view obtained from the castle combines
the characteristics of each, and its extent ranges over an area of fifty or
sixty miles in diameter&mdash;being on one side bounded by Lincoln Minster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1002" id="Page_1002">[1002]</a></span>
(which is, in a clear atmosphere, distinctly visible) and the hills beyond,
although thirty miles off “as the crow flies.” Its immediate neighbourhood,
the lovely and fertile “vale of Belvoir,” the theme of poet and
prose-writer, and the delight of the painter and lover of nature, lies
immediately below, while beyond are miles of lovely country, gloriously
diversified with wood and water, and studded at intervals with hamlets,
villages, and homesteads, which add greatly to the beauty of the scene.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Belvoir Castle from the Grantham Road.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A marked and peculiar character of Belvoir, and one of its greatest
charms, is that it stands in the midst of this open country, not within the
confines of its own park. There is no enclosed park; and park palings,
lodges, bolts, bars, and locks are unknown. The Duke, in this noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1003" id="Page_1003">[1003]</a></span>
mansion, rests in the midst of his immense estates, and draws no cordon
around him. The roads, right up to the very castle, are open and free to all,
and restriction is unknown. For miles in extent, and from every side, the
public may wander on foot, or ride or drive, through the estate and up to
the very doors, unmolested, and untrammelled by fear of porters, or deterred
by appliances of state or ceremony. The stronghold of the De Todenis,
the Albinis, the Especs, the De Ros’, and the Manners’, thus nestles securely
in the very heart of the country, as does its noble owner&mdash;the descendant
and representative of this long line of illustrious men&mdash;in the hearts of his
tenantry, his friends, and all who have the privilege of knowing him.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Arms of De Todeni, De Albini, and De Ros.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The history of Belvoir Castle dates back to very early times, and is
invested with more than ordinary interest. Leaving the question as to its
site having originally been a Celtic stronghold taken possession of and
formed into a station, or something of the kind, by the Romans, to be
discussed elsewhere, it is sufficient for our present purpose to say that at
the Norman Conquest, Belvoir, with some fourscore manors, was given by
William the Conqueror to his faithful standard-bearer, Robert de Todeni,
who here built a castle and founded a monastery. This monastery, situated
at the foot of the castle hill, and on whose site many interesting remains
have in late years been exhumed, was established in 1077, and was endowed
with large estates; its founder, Robert Belvidir or De Todeni, agreeing to
give to it for ever a tenth part of all the lands he might acquire by the
help of God or the grant of the King. This priory was established for four
monks of the Benedictine Order (and afterwards became a cell of the Abbey
of St. Albans), who were to pray for the souls of the King, of the Earl
of Cornwall, of Robert de Todeni, and Adelais, his wife, and of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1004" id="Page_1004">[1004]</a></span>
parents and children. Robert de Todeni died in 1088, and, with his wife,
who predeceased him, was buried in the priory at Belvoir which he had
founded. He was succeeded by his son William, who took the surname
of De Albini Brito, by whom the grants to the priory were confirmed
and increased, and he obtained for the monks a grant of a fair for eight
days in the year on the feast of St. John the Baptist. He married Maud
de St. Liz, widow of Robert de Tonebrigg, daughter of Simon, Earl of
Northampton and Huntingdon, and, dying in 1155, he, too, was buried
at Belvoir, and was succeeded by his son, William de Albini, or Meschines
(also buried here), who in turn was succeeded by his son, the third William
de Albini, whose name, in connection with King John and Magna Charta,
is matter of history. During his imprisonment at Corfe Castle by his
unforgiving king, Belvoir Castle was, at the summons of the sovereign,
surrendered into his hands. Under Henry III., Albini, being reinstated
in favour, had a chief command at the battle of Lincoln, and took part
in most of the stirring events of the period. Besides adding to the
endowments of Belvoir Priory, he founded the Hospital of Our Lady at
Newstead, for the health of the souls of himself and his two wives, and
there his body was buried in 1236, while his heart was placed under the
wall opposite the high altar at Belvoir. He married Agatha Trusbut,
for the privilege of marrying whom he gave the King 600 marks (about
£6,000 of our money). He was succeeded by his son, the fourth William
de Albini, or, as he was called, William de Belvoir, who left no male issue,
but, by his wife Albreda Biset, had an only child, a daughter Isabel, who
married Robert de Ros, Lord of Hamlake, fifth in regular descent from
Peter de Ros, who, by marriage with Adeline, daughter of Walter Espec,
became the inheritor of two princely fortunes. Thus by the marriage of
Isabel de Albini with Robert de Ros the estates of Espec, Ros, and Albini
became united.</p>

<p>This Robert de Ros, after his accession to the Belvoir estates, obtained
a grant of free warren and a weekly market there from Henry III. Later
on, as one of the insurgent barons, he was imprisoned and fined. In 1267
he raised a new embattled and fortified wall at Belvoir Castle. He died
in 1285; his body being buried at Kirkham, his bowels before the high
altar at Belvoir, and his heart at Croxton Abbey. At the suppression of
the monasteries part of the monument which had been placed over his
heart at Croxton was removed to Bottesford Church, where it still remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1005" id="Page_1005">[1005]</a></span>
in the chancel wall. His widow, Isabel, died in 1301, and was buried
at Newstead. He was succeeded by his son, William de Ros, who became
an unsuccessful competitor for the crown of Scotland, founding his claim
on his descent from his great-grandmother Isabel, daughter to William
the Lion, King of Scotland. By his marriage with Matilda de Vaux he
added to the family estates and ecclesiastical patronage; and on his death,
in 1317, was succeeded by his son, William de Ros, who was created Lord
Ros of Werke; became Baron Ros of Hamlake, Werke, Belvoir, and
Trusbut; was summoned to Parliament, second Edward II. to sixteenth
Edward III.; was made Lord High Admiral, and one of the Commissioners
to treat for peace with Robert Bruce. He died in 1342, and was succeeded
by his son, William de Ros, who, after a busy military life, fighting
against the Scots, at the siege of Calais, and against the Saracens, died
on his way to the Holy Land, and was buried abroad. He married
Margaret, daughter of Ralph, Lord Nevill, who survived him, and afterwards
married Sir Henry de Percy.</p>

<p>Dying without issue he was succeeded by his brother, Thomas de Ros;
who, having married, in 1359, Beatrice, daughter of the Earl of Strafford
and widow of the Earl of Desmond, was in turn followed by his son,
John de Ros, who dying without issue, was succeeded by his brother,
Sir William de Ros. Sir William was, with Walter, Bishop of Durham, and
the Earl of Northumberland, sent by King Henry IV. to arrange a treaty
of peace with Scotland. He was a favourite with the King, who gave
him many important offices; made him a K.G.; and granted him the
town of Chingford, in Essex. By his wife, Margaret, of the family of
the Earl of Arundel, Sir William had issue five sons and four daughters.
He died at Belvoir Castle in 1414, and was buried in the choir of that
priory, his monument being now at Bottesford. The next in succession
was John de Ros, son of the last named, who came to the title and
estates when only seventeen years of age. He was killed along with
the Duke of Clarence and others in 1421; and, dying without issue, had
for successor his brother, Sir Thomas de Ros, who married Eleanor,
daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, by whom he had
issue three sons, of whom his successor, Thomas, Lord Ros, was the
eldest, and who, at his father’s death in 1431, was only four years of age.</p>

<p>This nobleman, Thomas, Baron Ros of Hamlake, Trusbut, and Belvoir,
was by the King put into full possession of his father’s estates when only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1006" id="Page_1006">[1006]</a></span>
eighteen years of age. He married Philippa, eldest daughter of John de
Tiptoft, by whom he had issue one son and four daughters. For his fidelity
to the House of Lancaster in the Wars of the Roses, he was, with his
adherents, attainted in Parliament in 1461, and is said by Rapin to have
been beheaded. His estates were confiscated, and given to various adherents
of the House of York; Lord Hastings receiving Belvoir and its members.
By him Belvoir Castle was utterly despoiled, he carrying away the lead
from the roofs to Ashby-de-la-Zouch, to use in his own castle there, and
rendering the place no better than a ruin.</p>

<p>The next in succession, Edmund, Lord Ros, was by Henry VII. (who
had united the rival houses) restored to his father’s state and dignity; the
attainder was removed; and the Belvoir and other estates returned to
him. He died in 1508, at his house of Elsinges, at Enfield (in the church
at which, place is a noble monument erected to his memory), without issue,
and his estates were divided between his sisters and co-heiresses&mdash;viz.
Eleanor, married to Sir Robert Manners, Knight; and Isabel, married
to Sir Thomas Lovel. Belvoir, with Hamlake in Yorkshire, and Orston
in Nottinghamshire, being the portion of the elder sister, Eleanor, thus
passed into the hands of the family of Manners, in whom it has remained
in unbroken succession to the present hour. The manor of Elsinges,
which had passed to Sir Thomas Lovel, as part of his wife’s portion, was
bequeathed by him to the Earl of Rutland.</p>

<p>This Sir Robert Manners, who, as we have said, acquired Belvoir
through his marriage with one of the co-heiresses of
the last Lord de Ros, was descended from a long
line of Manners’ of Northumberland. The earliest of
these of whom there is direct evidence was Sir Robert
Manners, lord of the manor of Ethale, in Northumberland,
from whom descended another Sir Robert,
who married Philippa, daughter of Sir Bartholomew
de Mont Bouchier, by whom he had issue a son, also
named Robert, who married Hawise, daughter of
Robert, Baron de Muschamp, in the reign of Henry I.
Their great-grandson, another Sir Robert Manners, married Agnes,
daughter of Sir David Coupland. Their son, Sir Robert, had issue by
his wife, Joan de Heton, four sons, three of whom dying without issue,
the second son, William Manners, inherited the estates. He married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1007" id="Page_1007">[1007]</a></span>
Ellen, or Janetta, daughter of David Bagster, of Derby, by whom he had
a son, Sir Robert Manners.</p>

<p>This Sir Robert was returned, in the seventeenth year of Edward III.,
as one of the principal persons in the county of Northumberland, and was
entitled to bear arms by descent. In the first year of Edward’s reign, being
governor of Norham Castle, he distinguished himself by his successful
defence of that stronghold against the Scots, who, “despising King
Edward’s youth, on the very night of that day on which King Edward
was crowned, intended to take Norham Castle by surprise; and so well
managed their design that about sixteen of them had already mounted
the walls. But the captain, Sir Robert Manners, being warned of the
matter beforehand by one of his garrison, who was a Scotsman, had so
well prepared to receive them, that of those who had mounted he took
five or six, and put the rest to the sword, their companions below, upon
this disappointment, retiring.” In the next year he was constituted one
of the “conservators of the truce made with the Scots for all hostilities
to cease.” Soon afterwards he was made sheriff of the county of Selkirk,
and appointed to keep and defend the forts of Selkirk and Ettrick, &amp;c.
In the fourteenth of the same reign he represented Northumberland in
Parliament, and again subdued Scotch incursions. Soon afterwards he
obtained a license from the King “to strengthen and embattle his dwelling-house
at Ethale, in Northumberland, with a wall made of stone and lime,
and to hold the same to himself and his heirs for ever.” The next year
he was constituted one of the commissioners to treat with David Bruce
and his adherents for a peace, and subsequently was made Lord of the
Marches. At the battle of Neville’s Cross in 1346, under Queen Philippa,
in which the Scottish king was taken prisoner, Sir Robert displayed great
valour, and was intrusted to keep charge of the prisoners, and deliver
them to the Constable at the Tower of London. He died in 1355, leaving
his son and heir, John de Manners (by his wife, Aliva, or Alice, daughter
of Henry Strather), only one year and three weeks old.</p>

<p>This John Manners received the honour of knighthood, and married
Alice, widow of William de Whitchester; and, dying in 1402, was succeeded
by his son, Sir John Manners, who was sheriff of Northumberland,
and, with his son John, was accused of the murder of William Heron
and Robert Atkinson, or Akyman. They were prosecuted by Sir Robert
de Umphreville, and Isabel, widow of William Heron, and were ordered
to “cause 500 masses to be sung for the health of the soul of the same
William Heron within one year then next ensuing, and pay unto Sir
Robert de Umphreville, and Isabel, to the use of the said Isabel and her
children by Heron, 200 marks.” He was succeeded by his son Robert,
who married Joan, daughter of Sir Robert Ogle, and had issue by her,
with others, a son, Robert, by whom he was succeeded. This was the
Sir Robert Manners who married Eleanor, daughter of Thomas, Lord
Ros, as already shown. Sir Robert Manners had issue by his wife,
Eleanor Ros, three daughters, who each married into the family of
Fairfax, and two sons. The elder of these sons was Sir George Manners,
who, on the death of his mother, became Lord Ros or Roos, and was also
lineal heir to the baronies of Vaux, Trusbut, and Belvoir.</p>

<p class="dc19 p2">MARRYING Anne, only daughter and heiress of Sir
Thomas St. Leger, by his wife Anne, daughter of
Richard, Duke of York, and sister to King
Edward IV., and widow of John Holland, Duke
of Exeter, this lady brought royal blood into the
family. By her Sir George had a numerous family,
the eldest of whom, Thomas, succeeded him.</p>

<p>This Sir Thomas Manners, on the death of
his father, became thirteenth Lord Ros, of
Hamlake, and Baron Trusbut, Riveaulx, and
Belvoir. He was with Henry VIII. and his
queen at the celebrated interview between that
monarch and the King of France at Guisnes,
and in the same reign was made Warden of the
East Marches, and had many other honours granted
him. In the seventeenth year of the same monarch he
was created Earl of Rutland&mdash;“a title which none but
royal family had ever borne, and by reason of his
descent from the sister of King Edward IV. had an
augmentation to his ancient arms.” The old arms were&mdash;<i>or</i> two
bars <i>azure</i>, and a chief <i>gules</i>; which chief was augmented thus
quarterly <i>azure</i> and <i>gules</i>, in the first and fourth two fleurs-de-lis
and in the second and third a lion passant guardant, all <i>or</i>.
He was also installed a Knight of the Garter. A few years later this
nobleman was present at the second interview between Henry VIII. and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1010" id="Page_1010">[1010]</a></span>
Francis I.; he was also present at the marriage of his sovereign with
the ill-fated Anne Boleyn; and, later on, attended Anne of Cleves to
England, and was made her chamberlain. He was made Chief Justice in
Eyre of all the King’s lands north of the Trent, and obtained grants of the
manors of Muston, Waltham, Croxton, Upwell, Bilsdale, Helmsley, Outwell,
Elm, Emneth, Branston, &amp;c., and lands belonging to several dissolved
monasteries. He rebuilt Belvoir Castle, and removed many of the monuments
from the dissolved priories of Croxton and Belvoir to Bottesford,
where he himself was buried in 1543. His lordship&mdash;who took part in
most of the events of this stirring reign, and held numerous important
offices&mdash;married twice: first, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Robert Lovel; and
second, Eleanor, daughter of Sir William Paston, by the latter of whom
only he had issue. To the eldest and second of that issue we now refer.</p>

<p>The eldest son, Henry Manners, succeeded his father, in 1543, as second
Earl of Rutland. He continued the rebuilding of Belvoir Castle, and was
made Constable of Nottingham Castle, Chief Justice in Eyre of Sherwood
Forest, &amp;c. He was married twice: first, to Margaret, daughter of the
fourth Earl of Westmoreland, by whom he had issue; and second, to
Bridget, daughter of Lord Hussey, by whom he had no children. He was
succeeded by his eldest son, Edward Manners, as third Earl of Rutland,
who, dying without male issue, was succeeded by his brother, John
Manners (the second son of the second earl), as fourth Earl of Rutland.
This nobleman married Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Charlton, of Apsley,
by whom he had issue, with others, three sons&mdash;Roger Manners, Sir Francis
Manners, and Sir George Manners&mdash;who successively became fifth, sixth,
and seventh Earls of Rutland. All these dying without surviving male
issue, the title passed to the descendants of the second son of the first Earl,
as we shall now show.</p>

<p>Sir John Manners, second son of the first Earl of Rutland, and great-grandson
of the sister of King Edward IV., became, before he was
knighted, attached to Dorothy Vernon, the youngest daughter and co-heiress
of Sir George Vernon of Haddon Hall, known as “the King
of the Peak,” and so effectually wooed and won her, that he at length
carried her off on horseback into his own county of Leicester, and there
married her. By this marriage Haddon Hall, and the Derbyshire property
of the “King of the Peak,” passed into the family of Manners. Sir John
Manners had issue by his wife, Dorothy Vernon, three sons&mdash;Sir George,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1011" id="Page_1011">[1011]</a></span>
who succeeded him; John, who died at the age of fourteen; and Sir Roger,
of Whitwell; and one daughter, Grace, who married Sir Francis Fortescue,
of Salden. Sir George Manners, their son, married Grace, daughter of Sir
Henry Pierrepoint, and sister to the Earl of Kingston, by whom he had
issue, with others, John Manners, his eldest son, who not only succeeded
him, but also succeeded his cousin George, seventh Earl of Rutland, in his
title and estates, and thus became eighth Earl of Rutland. He married
Frances, daughter of Edward, Lord Montague of Boughton, by whom he
had issue four sons and seven daughters. He was sheriff of Derbyshire in
the ninth and eleventh years of Charles I., and also represented that county
in Parliament. His lordship was attached to the Parliamentary interest
during the civil wars, and was one of the twenty-two peers who remained
at Westminster when the King summoned both Houses to attend him at
Oxford. As a consequence, his castle of Belvoir was seized by the Royalists,
and was held by them and Sir Gervase Lucas, and here the King frequently
resided. It was finally surrendered to the Parliamentarians in January,
1645-6. In 1649 the castle was demolished, by consent of the Earl, who
soon afterwards set about rebuilding it, which he completed in 1668. During
this time the Earl lived principally at Haddon Hall, where he died in 1679,
and was succeeded by his third and only surviving son, John Manners, as
ninth Earl of Rutland.</p>

<p>This nobleman was born in 1638, and, in 1679 was created a peer in his
own right by the title of Baron Manners of Haddon; and in September of
the same year, his father dying, he became Earl of Rutland. When twenty
years of age he had married the Lady Anne Pierrepoint, daughter of the
Marquis of Dorchester, from whom he was afterwards divorced; and he
married, secondly, Lady Diana Bruce, widow of Sir Seymour Shirley, and
daughter of the Earl of Aylesbury, who died in child-bed. His lordship
married, thirdly, Catherine, daughter of Baptist Noel, Viscount Camden, by
whom only he had surviving issue. In 1703 the Earl was raised to the
highest dignity in the realm, by the titles of Marquis of Granby and Duke
of Rutland. He died in January, 1710-11, aged seventy-three, and was
succeeded by his only surviving son, John Manners.</p>

<p>John, second Duke of Rutland, when scarcely seventeen years of age,
was married to Katherine, second daughter of Lord William Russell, who
was beheaded in 1683. He then bore the title of Lord Roos; and the
wedding festivities seem, judging from some curious letters still extant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1012" id="Page_1012">[1012]</a></span>
concerning them, to have been of the most lavishly extravagant character.
This lady, who was sister to the Duchess of Devonshire and to the Duke of
Bedford, gave birth to five sons and four daughters, and died in child-bed in
1711. The Duke married, secondly, Lucy, daughter of Lord Sherard, and
sister of the Earl of Harborough, by whom also he had issue six sons and
two daughters. His grace died in 1721, and was succeeded, as third Duke
of Rutland, by his eldest son, John Manners. This nobleman, who was
born in 1696, married, in 1717, Bridget, only daughter and heiress of
Robert Sutton, Lord Lexington (an alliance that gave him a large accession
of estates), by whom he had issue thirteen children, nearly all of whom died
young. He it was who built the hunting-seat at Croxton, and made
many improvements at Belvoir Castle. He was the last of the family who
made Haddon Hall a residence. The estates of Lord Lexington having
been settled upon the younger branch of the family, the second and
surviving sons, successively, took, by Act of Parliament, the additional
surname of Sutton, and thus founded the family of Manners-Sutton.</p>

<p>The Duke, who was familiarly known as “Old John of the Hill,” dying
in 1779, was succeeded by his grandson, Charles Manners, son of the celebrated
Marquis of Granby, Commander-in-chief of the British forces in
Germany, and Master of the Ordnance, who died during his father’s lifetime.
Charles, fourth Duke of Rutland, married Mary Isabella, daughter
of Charles Noel, Duke of Beaufort, by whom he had issue four sons&mdash;viz.
Lord John Henry (who succeeded him), Lord Charles Henry Somerset,
Lord Robert William, and Lord William Robert Albini; and two daughters&mdash;viz.
the Lady Elizabeth Isabella, married to Richard Norman, Esq., and
Lady Catherine Mary, married to Lord Forester. His Grace died while
holding office as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and was succeeded by his
eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>John Henry Manners, as fifth Duke of Rutland, who married Elizabeth,
daughter of the Earl of Carlisle, and by her had issue six sons
and five daughters. The sons were&mdash;Lord George Henry Manners,
to whom King George III. stood sponsor in person, but who died in
infancy; Lord George John Frederick Manners, to whom the Prince Regent
and H.R.H. the Duke of York stood sponsors in person, but who also died
in infancy; Lord Charles Cecil John Manners (the present Duke of
Rutland); Lord Adolphus Edward Manners, who died in infancy: Lord
John James Robert Manners, M.P., the present eminent statesman and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1013" id="Page_1013">[1013]</a></span>
man of letters; and Lord George John Manners, M.P., who married in
1855 the Lady Adeliza Matilda Howard, daughter of the thirteenth Duke of
Norfolk, and died in 1875. The five daughters were&mdash;the Lady Caroline
Isabella Manners, who died in infancy; the Lady Elizabeth Frederica
Manners, now the widow of Andrew Robert Drummond, Esq.; the Lady
Emmeline Charlotte Elizabeth Manners (deceased), married to the Hon.
Charles Stuart Wortley; the Lady Katherine Isabella Manners (deceased),
married to Earl Jermyn; and the Lady Adeliza Gertrude Elizabeth
Manners, married to the Rev. Frederick John Norman, Rector of Bottesford.</p>

<p>The present noble head of the House of Manners is, as we have just
stated, his Grace Charles Cecil John Manners, the sixth Duke of Rutland,
Marquis of Granby, fourteenth Earl of Rutland, Baron Manners of Haddon,
Baron Ros of Hamlake, Baron Trusbut, Riveaulx, and Belvoir, K.G., &amp;c.,
the “King of Belvoir,” as he may not inaptly be called, for his is a regal
residence, and he reigns in the hearts of the people around him. He is,
therefore, the direct descendant and representative in unbroken succession
of the grand old standard-bearer of William the Conqueror, Robert de
Todeni, and of the families of De Albini, Espec, De Ros, and Manners;
and by equally direct descent he has royal blood coursing through his veins.
His grace was born in 1815, and was educated at Eton and at Trinity
College, Cambridge, where he took his M.A. degree in 1835; was M.P. for
Stamford from 1837 to 1852, and from that time to his accession to the
titles in 1867, for North Leicestershire; and he was a Lord of the Bed-chamber
to the late Prince Consort. His grace is not married, the heir
to his titles, estates, and revenues being his brother, Lord John Manners,
who is a worthy representative of the long and illustrious line from which
he has sprung. The Duke is patron of twenty-four livings, of which one is
in Rutland, fifteen in Leicestershire, two in Lincolnshire, two in Cambridgeshire,
two in Nottinghamshire, and two in Derbyshire. His seats are&mdash;Belvoir
Castle, in Leicestershire; Haddon Hall and Longshawe Lodge, in
Derbyshire; and Cheveley Park, in Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>Lord John Manners was born in 1818, and in 1851 married Louisa
Catherine, daughter of Colonel Marlay, by whom he had issue one son
(the present Henry John Brinsley Manners), and another who died in
infancy. This lady, dying in 1854, was buried at Rowsley, where a magnificent
monument&mdash;one of the happiest efforts of W. Calder Marshall&mdash;has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1014" id="Page_1014">[1014]</a></span>
been erected to her memory. His lordship married secondly, in 1862,
Janetta, eldest daughter of Thomas Hughan, Esq., by whom he has issue
several children. Lord John Manners has held many important offices.
He was sworn a Privy Councillor, and appointed First Commissioner of
Works and Buildings, which office he held many years, and in 1874 was
appointed Postmaster-General.</p>

<p>Belvoir Castle, as it now stands, is an erection of the present century,
built upon Norman foundations. As we have already stated, the first castle
was built by Robert de Todeni, standard-bearer to William the Conqueror,
and considerably extended by his successors. In 1461, or thereabouts, it was
despoiled (on the attainder of its noble owner) by the Lord Hastings, to
whom it had been granted by the King. “The timber of the roof, being”
by him “despoiled of the lead with which it was covered, rotted away;
and the soil between the walls at the last grew full of elders, in which
state the castle remained till it was partially rebuilt by the first Earl of
Rutland, and completed by the second.” On the dissolution of the monasteries,
many of the monuments of the Albini and Ros families were, by
order of the first Earl, and later, by his successor, removed from Belvoir
Priory to Bottesford Church, and others were also brought to the same
place from Croxton Abbey. He commenced the rebuilding of the castle,
which was completed by his son in 1555, “making it a nobler structure
than it was before.”</p>

<p>In 1619 the singular trial of an old woman, named Joan Flower, of
Belvoir, and her two daughters, Margaret and Philippa, for sorcery, and
causing the deaths of the two sons of the Earl of Rutland, took place, and
resulted in the execution of the two younger “witches,” the old “monstrous
malicious woman,” or “devil incarnate,” as she was styled, having
died as she was being taken to gaol; and the destruction of her cat,
“Rutterkin.” The two sons, whose deaths were laid to the charge of
these miserable victims of superstition, were Henry, Lord Ros, and Francis
Manners, his brother, sons of Francis, sixth Earl of Rutland, by his second
wife, Cecilia, daughter of Sir John Tufton, and widow of Sir Henry
Hungerford. That Joan Flower, aided by her profligate daughters, did
cause the deaths of the two children, and attempt the lives of the Earl and
Countess, probably by poison, seems most probable, and they were justly
punished. The following account of this singular transaction, printed
in 1619, describes&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Joan Flower as a monstrous woman, full of oaths, curses, and imprecations; and for
any thing they saw by her, a plain atheist. Besides, of late days, her very countenance was
estranged, her eyes very fiery and hollow, her speech fell and envious, her demeanour
strange and exotic, and her conversation sequestered; so that the whole course of her life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1016" id="Page_1016">[1016]</a></span>
gave great suspicion that she was a notorious witch; yea, some of her neighbours dared to
affirm that she dealt with familiar spirits, and terrified them all with curses and threatening
of revenge, if there were never so little cause of displeasure and unkindness. Concerning
Margaret, the daughter, that she often resorted from the castle to her mother, bringing such
provision as they thought was unbefitting for a servant to purloin; and coming at such
unseasonable hours that they could not but conjecture some mischief between them, and
that their extraordinary riot and expenses tended both to rob the lady and to maintain
certain deboist and base company, which frequented this Joan Flower’s house, the mother,
and especially the youngest daughter. Concerning Philippa, that she was leudly transported
with the love of one Thomas Simpson, who presumed to say that she had bewitched
him, for he had no power to leave her, and was, as he supposed, marvellously altered both
in mind and body, since her acquainted company. These complaints began many years
before either their conviction or public apprehension. Notwithstanding, such was the
honour of this earl and his lady; such was the cunning of this monstrous woman, in
observation towards them; such was the subtlety of the devil, to bring his purposes to
pass; such was the pleasure of God, to make trial of his servants; and such was the effect
of a damnable woman’s wit and malicious envy, that all things were carried away in the
smooth channel of liking and good entertainment, on every side, until the earl refused to
give that credence to her, on some complaint preferred, which he had been accustomed to
give; and the countess discovering in the daughter Margaret some indecencies of her life,
and neglect of her business, discharged her from lying any more in the castle; dismissing
her with handsome presents, but commanding her to go home. This inflamed the mother
with hatred and rancour towards the earl, and his family.</p>

<p>“When the devil perceived the inficious disposition of this wretch, and that she, and
her daughters, might easily be made instruments to enlarge his kingdom; and be, as it were,
the executioners of his vengeance, not caring whether it lighted upon innocents, or no; he
came more near unto them, and in plain terms, to come quickly to the purpose, offered them
his service, and that in such a manner, as they might easily command what they pleased;
for he would attend you in such pretty forms of dog, cat, or rat, that they should neither
be terrified, nor any body else suspicious of the matter. Upon this, they agree, and (as it
should seem) give away their souls to the service of such spirits, as he had promised them;
which filthy conditions were ratified with abominable kisses, and an odious sacrifice of
blood, not leaving out certain charms and conjurations, with which the devil deceived
them, as though nothing could be done without ceremony, and a solemnity of orderly
ratification. By this time doth sathan triumph, and goeth away satisfied to have caught
such fish in the net of his illusions: by this time, are these women devils incarnate, and
grow proud again in their cunning and artificial power, to do what mischief they listed. By
this time, they have learnt the manner of incantations, spells, and charms. By this time,
they kill what cattle they list; and under the cover of flattery and familiar entertainment,
keep hidden the stinging serpent of malice, and a venomous inclination to mischief. By this
time, is the earl and his family threatened, and must feel the burthen of a terrible tempest,
which, by these women’s devilish devices, fell upon him; he neither suspecting nor understanding
the same. By this time, both himself and his honourable countess, are many times
subject to sickness and extraordinary convulsions; which they, taking as gentle corrections
from the hand of God, submit with quietness to his mercy, and study nothing more than
to glorify their Creator in heaven, and bear his crosses on earth.</p>

<p>“At last, as malice increased in these damnable women, so his family felt the smart of
their revenge and inficious disposition; for his eldest son, Henry, Lord Rosse, sickened
very strangely, and after awhile, died. His next, named Francis, Lord Rosse accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1017" id="Page_1017">[1017]</a></span>
was severely tormented by them, and most barbarously, and inhumanly tortured by a
strange sickness. Not long after, the Lady Catherine was set upon by their dangerous and
devilish practices; and many times in great danger of life, through extreme maladies and
unusual fits, nay, (as it should seem, and they afterwards confessed) both the earl and his
countess were brought into their snares, as they imagined, and indeed determined to keep
them from having any more children. Oh unheard of wickedness and mischievous damnation!
Notwithstanding all this, did the noble earl attend his majesty, both at Newmarket,
before Christmas; and at Christmas, at Whitehall; bearing the loss of his children most
nobly; and little suspecting that they had miscarried by witchcraft, or such like inventions
of the devil; until it pleased God to discover the villanous practices of these women, and to
command the devil from executing any further vengeance on innocents, but leave them to
their shames, and the hands of justice, that they might not only be confounded for their
villanous practices, but remain as a notorious example to all ages, of his judgment and fury.
Thus were they apprehended, about Christmas, and carried to Lincoln gaol; after due
examination, before sufficient justices of the peace, and discreet magistrates, who wondered
at their audacious wickedness. But Joan Flower, the mother, before her conviction, (as
they say,) called for bread and butter, and wished it might never go through her, if she
were guilty of that whereupon she was examined; so, mumbling it in her mouth, never
spake more words after; but fell down and died, as she was carried to Lincoln gaol, with
a horrible excruciation of soul and body, and was buried at Ancaster.</p>

<p>“When the earl heard of their apprehension, he hasted down with his brother, Sir
George, and sometimes examined them himself, and sometimes sending them to others; at
last, left them to the trial of law, before the judges of assize at Lincoln; and so they were
convicted of murder, and executed accordingly, about the eleventh of March, to the terror
of all beholders as example of such dissolute and abominable creatures.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">On the stately monument of the Earl at Bottesford the death of these
two sons is thus alluded to:&mdash;“In 1608 he married the Lady Cecelia
Hungerf’rd, daughter to the Hon’ble Knight, Sir John Tufton, by whom
he had two sonnes, both which dyed in their infancy, by wicked practice
and sorcerye.”</p>

<p>In the civil wars Belvoir Castle was taken by the Royalist party in 1642,
and placed under command of Colonel Lucas. In 1645 the King himself
was there. In the same year Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice were
at Belvoir. Soon afterwards it was besieged by the Parliamentarians; the
outworks and stables, which had been fortified, were taken by storm; the
entire village of Belvoir was demolished; and on the 3rd of February, 1646,
the castle, with its appurtenances, was, in pursuance of terms of capitulation,
surrendered to the Parliament, who immediately appointed Captain
Markham as its governor. Shortly afterwards the castle was disgarrisoned
and restored to its owner, the Earl of Rutland. In 1649 the Council of
State reported “their resolution for demolishing the castle; which the
Earl of Rutland was content with,” and it was accordingly demolished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1018" id="Page_1018">[1018]</a></span>
the Earl receiving a miserable pittance by way of compensation, and taking
up his residence at Haddon Hall. About 1662 the Earl appears to have
commenced the rebuilding of the castle, which was completed in 1668.
In 1801 the then Duke of Rutland, father of the present duke, who had,
during his minority, conceived the idea of rebuilding and extending the
castle, began to carry out his design by pulling down the south and west
fronts next to the court-yard, and continued rebuilding under Wyatt till
1816, by which time the south-west and south-east parts were completed,
and the Grand Staircase and Picture Gallery in the north-west front were
nearly finished. In that year a fire broke out in the castle, by which the
north-east and north-west fronts were entirely destroyed. By that fire
a large number of valuable paintings, estimated at nearly eleven thousand
pounds in value, were totally destroyed. Among these were no less than
nineteen by Sir Joshua Reynolds (including the “Nativity” and a number
of family portraits); and many by Rubens, Vandyke, Carlo Maratti, Lely,
Domenichino, Rembrandt, Velasquez, Titian, Poussin, West, and others.
Fortunately, although five children of the Duke and Duchess (who themselves
were at Cheveley), and all the household were sleeping in the castle,
no loss of life occurred. In March, 1817, the Duke commenced rebuilding
the castle, the architect being the Rev. Sir John Thoroton, of Bottesford,
to whose good taste and that of the Duke and his amiable duchess, are
due the fine proportions and the majestic character of the building as it
now stands.</p>

<p>Belvoir has often been visited by royalty. James I. and Charles I.
both stayed there, and in 1813, the Prince Regent, afterwards George IV.,
and the Duke of York, spent several days there. In 1839 the
Dowager Queen Adelaide remained there for nearly a week, and in
1843 our present beloved Queen Victoria, with the Prince Consort, the
Queen Dowager, the Duke of Wellington, and others, visited the Duke,
and remained his guests for four days. In 1866 their Royal Highnesses the
Prince and Princess of Wales visited Belvoir, and the Prince again remained
there in 1873. Other members of the royal family have also been received
within its walls.</p>

<p>The principal apartments of the castle are, by kind permission of the
Duke, shown to visitors, and the surrounding grounds are literally, as
we have before said, open to all, “without let or hindrance.”</p>

<p>Passing up the steep ascent from near the cosy inn (on, or closely adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1019" id="Page_1019">[1019]</a></span>
to, the site of the old priory), the visitor, if on foot, wends his way along
the path among magnificent forest trees, and up a flight of stone steps
to the basement story of the castle, where, in the solid masonry from
which the superstructure rises, are the workshops of the artisan retainers
of the family; and from hence by a rising pathway to the bastion, mounted
with cannon, which gives an air of baronial importance to the place. If
the visitor ride or drive, the ascent is somewhat more circuitous, but the
carriage-way leads to the same point&mdash;the Grand Entrance to the Castle.</p>

<p>The Grand Entrance, which is shown to the spectator’s left in our general
views from the north-west, opens from an advanced groined porch, into
which carriages drive from one side, and out at the other, massive doors
enclosing them while visitors alight. Over the doors are armorial bearings
of the family and its alliances. From the porch the entrance doorway
opens into the groined entrance passage, or corridor, decorated with stands
of arms, banners (among which is the one borne by the present Duke of
Rutland at the funeral of the Duke of Wellington), and military trophies,
which leads to the Guard-room, or Great Hall of the mansion. This
noble room, which has a groined ceiling, and a mosaic floor of black and
white marble and Nottinghamshire freestone, bears in recesses and arcades
on its walls groups of arms and armour, trophies of war, and other appropriate
decorations; and in two glazed recesses a number of relics of the
great Marquis of Granby, and of his brilliant military achievements, and
his well-earned decorations. Besides many other objects of peculiar interest
in this room are two tables made from remarkable deposits, of eleven
years’ formation, in the wooden water-pipes of the Blithe Mine in Derbyshire;
a model of the old castle; standards, arms, and armour from the
field of Waterloo; a Chinese junk; and some good armour.</p>

<p>Opposite the entrance are the Grand Staircase and the Guard-room
Gallery. In the windows of the latter are finely executed stained-glass
figures (by Wyatt) of Robert de Todeni, William de Albini, Walter Espec,
and Robert de Ros, with their armorial insignia. From the landing at
the head of the Guard-room Staircase, which contains full-length portraits
of Queen Anne and George Prince of Denmark, access is gained to the
Grand Staircase leading to the principal apartments; the walls of the
staircase itself being hung with full-length paintings of the first eight
Earls of Rutland, with their armorial bearings within the archways. The
ceiling is richly groined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1020" id="Page_1020">[1020]</a></span></p>

<p>The Regent’s Gallery, so called from the Prince Regent (George IV.),
for whose use it was fitted up on his visit to Belvoir in 1813, is one of
the main features of the castle. It is a noble apartment, 128 feet long
by 18 feet wide, with a central bow, formed by the central tower, of 36 feet
wide. At one end is Nollekens’ fine bust of George IV., and at the other
the equally fine bust of the late estimable duke, while other parts of
the room are adorned with corresponding sculptures of the late Duchess
of Rutland, the Marquis of Granby, Lord Robert Manners, Pitt, Cromwell,
William III., George II., Earl of Mansfield, Duke of Somerset, Earl
of Chatham, Admiral Keppel, and others. One striking feature of this
gallery is the Gobelins tapestry (eight pieces) which adorns the walls.
It is in perfect preservation, and represents scenes in the story of
Don Quixote from designs by Coypel, and appear to have been made in
1770. The walls are also adorned by many family portraits and other
paintings by Reynolds, Hoppner, Kneller, Smirke, Lely, Bishop, Zucchero,
Stothard, and others. The appointments of this splendid room are arranged
with perfect taste, and it is filled with objects of interest and beauty; one
object that often attracts attention being a carved chair, bearing an inscription
showing that it was made, as is also one belonging to the Queen,
from the wood of the tree at La Haye Sainte, against which the Duke of
Wellington took up his station at the battle of Waterloo. The opposite
end of the Regent’s Gallery to that at which the visitor enters from the
Grand Staircase is one gigantic mirror filling the whole space, and thus,
in appearance, giving it a double length. From this end one doorway
leads to the private gallery of the chapel, and another opens into the
library.</p>

<p>The Library is entirely of oak, the ceiling divided into compartments,
with carved bosses at the intersections, and armorial bearings decorating
other parts. Over the fire-place Grant’s fine portrait of the late duke,
“presented to his grace as a token of affection and esteem by his tenantry,
27th February, 1856,” is placed, and forms a pleasant feature in the room.
The collection of books is, as is natural to expect, of the most choice and
costly kind, many of the literary treasures being priceless gems of past
ages. Among these are several curious and valuable MS. rarities and
sketches by the old masters.</p>

<p>The Picture Gallery, a noble apartment of admirable proportions, has
a coved ceiling, rising from a cornice richly ornamented in gold and white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1021" id="Page_1021">[1021]</a></span>
with figures and foliage in bold relief. The collection of pictures in this
gallery, some two hundred in number, is remarkably fine and choice, and
contains many notable examples of the best and most reputed masters&mdash;Murillo,
Rubens, Teniers, Gerard Douw, Rembrandt, Claude, Gaspar
Poussin, Parmigiano, Carlo Dolce, Berghem, Carracci, Guido, Vandyke,
Holbein, Bassano, Paul Veronese, Bronzino, Van der Heyden, Netscher,
Van der Velde, Reynolds, Jansen, Ruysdael, Correggio, Albert Dürer,
Dekker, Schalken, Spagnoletto, Caravaggio, Wouvermans, Cuyp, and a
host of others.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Grand Corridor, or Ball-room.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Duchess’s Boudoir, a lovely room, commanding an almost enchanting
view of the grounds and distant country, was the favourite apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1022" id="Page_1022">[1022]</a></span>
of the late duchess, and remains as left by her. Like the other private
rooms, passages, and corridors, it contains many genuine pictures of note
as well as family portraits.</p>

<p>The Grand Corridor, or Ball-room, which, seen from the landing of
the staircase, is shown in the engraving on the preceding page, is one of
the most striking features of the interior of the castle. It is of Gothic
design, the whole being of stone, and copied from various parts of Lincoln
Cathedral. It is lit by nine windows in length, with stained-glass armorial
decorations, and has an elegant groined ceiling, with carved bosses at the
intersections; and the walls are arcaded, and contain full-length life-size
and other portraits of the present noble duke (two) by Grant; the late
Lady John Manners, by Buckner; Lord Robert Manners, by Reynolds;
and several others.</p>

<p>The Queen’s Sitting-room, or Green Assembling-room, in the Staunton
Tower, besides being an elegant apartment, commands a magnificent view
of the charming grounds and the distant country, including Croxton with
the Duke’s Deer Park, Woolsthorpe, Harlaxton, the Kennels, and the
Lake. Adjoining this are the Chinese Rooms&mdash;a suite of bed and dressing
rooms, so called from the style of their furniture and papering&mdash;which were
occupied by our beloved Queen in 1843.</p>

<p>The Grand Dining-room has a richly panelled ceiling of white and
gold, and contains a side-table of white marble, carved by Wyatt, so as to
look like a table “covered with a white linen table napkin; the folds being
so accurately represented in the marble as to require a close inspection to
convince the observer of the solidity of the material.” It weighs between
two and three tons. In this room are magnificent examples, life-size full-length
portraits, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and others by Sir Godfrey Kneller.</p>

<p>The Elizabeth Saloon, so called after the late duchess (Elizabeth, second
daughter of Frederick Howard, Earl of Carlisle, and wife of John Henry,
fifth Duke of Rutland), by whose taste and judgment it was arranged
and decorated. The walls are hung with satin drapery, and the ceiling,
which was painted by Wyatt, is filled with mythological subjects and
family and other portraits. The furniture and appliances are sumptuous
and elegant, and altogether this saloon is the most gorgeous in the castle.
Among its Art treasures are a full-length marble statue of the late duchess
by Wyatt; two full-length life-size portraits of the late duke and duchess
by Sanders; several rare enamels and pictures; a number of choice watercolour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1023" id="Page_1023">[1023]</a></span>
drawings; an extensive series of cabinet portraits, &amp;c.; and many
cabinets, caskets, and other choice objects.</p>

<p>Other apartments are the King’s Rooms, so called because used by the
Prince Regent while at Belvoir; the Hunters’ Dining-room; the Wellington
Rooms, so named because occupied by the Duke of Wellington; the Family
Dining-room, &amp;c., but these require no word of comment.</p>

<p>The Chapel, with panelled stone walls and elegant groined ceiling, has
a canopied reredos, containing one of Murillo’s grandest and choicest works&mdash;the
“Holy Family,” whose value is estimated at four thousand guineas.</p>

<p>The Wine Cellar in the Staunton Tower, with its vaulted ceiling and
carved boss with crowned monogram of the Blessed Virgin, is one of the oldest
parts of the castle. The Ale Cellar is said to contain thirty-one thousand gallons
of liquor! The largest tun, which holds about thirteen hundred gallons of
ale, is called after the founder of the castle, “Robert de Todeni,” while the
next three largest are named respectively the “Marquis of Granby,” “Lord
John,” and “Lord George.” The Housekeeper’s Rooms, with their fine
assemblage of old Chelsea, Derby, Sèvres, and other china services; the
Steward’s Room; the Plate Pantry, with the grand and invaluable services
of plate; the kitchens and other offices, perhaps the most perfect of any in
their arrangements and appliances, are all deserving more notice than the
mere mention we can give them.</p>

<p>The Muniment-room, under the able guardianship of Mr. Green, is, in
our eyes, one of the most important and interesting features of the castle,
and one in which we would fain “live and move and have our being” for
the rest of our lives. It is a perfect mine of historical wealth, and as a
storehouse of genealogical and antiquarian lore is unsurpassed by any other
mansion. It literally overflows with deeds and MSS. of one kind or other,
and all in the most admirable order and condition. The deeds in this room
are above four thousand in number, the greater part of which date back to
the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1025" id="Page_1025">[1025]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the
treasures are the cartularies and registers of Belvoir Priory and Croxton
Abbey; rent-rolls of Croxton; household books of various early periods;
a vast amount of original letters; personal accounts and bills relating to
Haddon Hall; inventories of Riveaulx Abbey, Belvoir, Croxton, St. Dunstans-in-the-West,
Haddon, &amp;c.; plea-rolls, charters, and grants and confirmations
of lands, pedigrees, agreements, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One of the great glories of Belvoir, however, is its grounds and surroundings;
but to these, which to do them justice would require a special
article to themselves, we can only devote a few brief lines.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Statue Garden.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The whole place
is a labyrinth of beauty, each separate spot that we come to exceeding in
exquisite loveliness those we have passed, and each turn bringing to view
fresh glimpses of charming scenery which show how well Nature has been
studied, and how thoroughly Art, with the pure and accomplished taste of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1026" id="Page_1026">[1026]</a></span>
the late duchess, has been wedded to her. The Duchess’s Garden, below
the slope on the west of the castle, is formed in an exquisite glade, surrounded
on all sides by grand old trees and luxuriant shrubs; the beds
terraced one above the other, or gently sloped and planted in amphitheatre
form, with masses of colour which give a richness and peculiarity to
the scene. The Duke’s Walk&mdash;an avenued path extending in its devious
way for about three miles in length&mdash;passes above this garden, and is
broken by glimpses of all the varied scenery on the way, and rendered
pleasant by rustic summer-houses, seats, and other resting-places. Near to
the Duchess’s Garden, in this walk, a tablet, admirably carved by the late
Mr. Bath, of Haddon, bears a sonnet from the pen of the fifth duke in
memory of the duchess. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“One cultivated spot behold, which spreads</p>
<p class="pp7">Its flowery bosom to the noontide beam&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp6">Where num’rous rosebuds rear their blushing heads,</p>
<p class="pp7">And poppies rich, and fragrant violets teem.</p>
<p class="pp6">Far from the busy world’s unceasing sound&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp7">Here has Eliza fixed her favourite seat,</p>
<p class="pp6">Chaste emblem of the scene around&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp7">Pure as the flower that smiles beneath her feet.”</p>

<p class="p1">Of the character of the Duchess’s Garden a writer in the <i>Journal of
Horticulture</i> (to which we are indebted for the two beautiful engravings
on pages 8 and 24), thus speaks:&mdash;“This is a beautiful glade of considerable
extent, surrounded on all sides by trees of grand dimensions,
which on our visit were in their early beauty, developing those varied
tints of green which, if not quite so glowing as the autumnal ones, are
at any rate fresher, and, moreover, are associated with the thoughts of the
lengthening and brightening days of summer, and not with the shortening
and darkening days of winter. In this glade the natural rocks have
been accommodated to the requirements of Alpine gardening, while the
upper portion has been arranged in beds.” “The bedding pansies, the
oxlips (of which the Belvoir strain is remarkably fine), were in flower. The
beautiful <i>Gentiana verna</i>, accommodated with nice little ledges on which
its brilliant blue shone out brilliantly, the bright yellow <i>Doronicum Austriacum</i>,
and other fine plants were there. And then how beautiful were the
blue forget-me-nots! how luxuriantly fine the <i>Saxifraga crassifolia</i>! Then,
again, we had the brilliant blue of <i>Lithospermum prostratum</i> as it trailed
over the rockery, and that of its larger congener, <i>L. Gastoni</i>. Of a softer but
no less beautiful shade of blue was <i>Myosotis dissitiflora</i>, though now nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1027" id="Page_1027">[1027]</a></span>
past, as it is the earliest of the tribe. Then how fine was <i>Veratrum nigrum</i>,
beautiful for its foliage!” “Then there were bright masses of <i>Dianthus
neglectus</i> and <i>alpinus</i>, with their dense tufts of lovely pink flowers; and
turn which way you will, gems of rarity or beauty met the eye.” “One
likes to linger on these slopes; and as one stands on the upper portion
of it, and looks down on the carpet of lovely green backed by the feathery
and elegant foliage of the birch, it is indeed hard to be obliged to tear one’s
self away from it.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Belvoir Castle, from the Stables, showing the Covered Exercise-ground.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Statue Garden, one of the most striking “bits” in the grounds, is
so called from a number of statues by Cibber which adorn it. This garden,
when viewed from the terrace, entirely screened from observation from the
castle, is one of marvellous and old-world beauty; the majestic and venerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1028" id="Page_1028">[1028]</a></span>
silver firs&mdash;remarkable for their gigantic growth and their hoary age&mdash;the
grounds, half garden, half wood (a strange combination of natural wildness
with artificial planting), adding much to the effect of the scene.</p>

<p>The Dairy, the Kennels, the Stables with the covered Exercise-ground,
and the Farm, as well as the magnificent Lake of ninety acres in extent, are
all objects of special interest, but to them we can only thus allude.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Gardener’s Cottage.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Mausoleum is situated on the summit of an eminence on the opposite
side of the valley from the castle, on a spot immediately facing the windows
of the Duchess’s boudoir, chosen by herself as a fit place wherein she might
rest. Her grace died in 1825, and was buried at Bottesford Church. In
1826 the mausoleum was commenced, and completed in 1828, when her body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1029" id="Page_1029">[1029]</a></span>
and those of nine other members of the family, were removed to it and
deposited in the vault. Since then others have been removed there, and the
“good duke” also there rests, as does the lamented Lord George Manners
(brother of the present duke), who died in November, 1874. The mausoleum
is approached by an avenue of grand old yews, which give a solemnity to the
place which is eminently in keeping with its character. The building is in
the Norman style, and consists of what may perhaps be called a chapel, with
apse and a projecting porch, and vaults beneath. Within the apse, lit with
a flood of golden light from above, is one of the most exquisitely beautiful
pieces of sculpture it has been our good fortune to see. On it the Duchess is
represented as rising from the admirably sculptured tomb with expanded
arms, and her face elevated towards the clouds, in which are seen four
cherubs&mdash;the children who preceded her to the grave&mdash;one of whom is holding
over her a crown of glory. It is by Wyatt, and is considered to be his
masterpiece.</p>

<p>The Kitchen and Fruit Gardens are about eight acres in extent within the
walls, and more than that outside. They are arranged in the most effective,
convenient, and admirable manner, and managed with that care and judgment
which are the distinguishing characteristics of the head gardener’s
skill. His charming cottage forms one of our vignettes; it is overgrown
with clematis and other climbing plants, which grow with natural
luxuriance over its porch and hedgerows. Nature, indeed, in the grounds
and gardens of Belvoir, is the first, the main, and the ultimate study; and
thus at all points, and in every direction, natural instead of artificial
beauties present themselves to the eye, and give the greatest charm of all to
whatever the visitor sees. Wild flowers are especially cultivated and bedded
out in all their native simplicity, while numbers of Alpine and other plants
are also acclimatised, and mingle their beauties with those of our own
country. <i>Belvoir</i> is indeed well named, not only for its “beautiful prospect”
from the building itself, but its hundreds of beautiful prospects within its
own boundaries.</p>

<p>Well might a gifted authoress thus write on leaving so lovely a place as
Belvoir Castle and its surroundings:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Farewell, fair castle, on thy lordly hill<br />
Firm be thy seat, and proud thy station still:<br />
Soft rise the breezes from the vale below&mdash;<br />
Bright be the clouds that wander o’er thy brow:<br />
O’er the fair lands that form thy broad domain,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1030" id="Page_1030">[1030]</a></span>Short be the winter&mdash;long the summer reign.<br />
Pilgrim of pleasure to thy stately towers,<br />
Fain would I leave among thy friendly bowers<br />
Some votive offering&mdash;and, ere on my way<br />
With many a backward glance I turn to stray,<br />
Bid virtue, strength, and honour crown thy walls;<br />
Joy, love, and peace abide within thy halls;<br />
While grateful mirth and noble courtesy,<br />
As now, for ever, hold their seat in thee;<br />
And still upon thy lordly turrets rest<br />
The grateful blessing of each parting guest.”</p>

<p class="p1">The neighbourhood of Belvoir Castle is one of great beauty, and
it is rich in objects of interest both to the botanist, the naturalist, and the
geologist; while to the lover of Nature it presents charms of unusual attraction.
In the hills and vales surrounding the castle, nearly the whole series
of lower oolitic rocks may be traced, from the white limestone down to the
black liassic shales. Capping the hills to the south, which are of greater
elevation than the castle, is the inferior oolite, or rather a variety of it called
“Lincolnshire limestone,” a hard, light rock, very rich in fossil remains.
On these hills the growth of trees is stunted, but the ground is covered with
a profusion of lovely flowers. Underlying the oolite is the upper lias clay, rich
in fossils and shells. Belvoir Castle itself stands on the extremity of a long
northern spur of these hills, upon the middle lias, or marlstone, which caps
all the neighbouring heights, and gives their soil a remarkably red tinge.
It is very rich in iron, both in veins and in lump ore. The vale of Belvoir,
below the castle, towards the north, lies mostly upon the lower lias, which is
celebrated for its richness in fossil remains, some of the ammonites here
found being of gigantic size. The vale is, however, best known to geologists
on account of its sauria, which are both numerous and well preserved. In
the old river-ways and hollows of the vale, in the drift, are also found traces
of the mammoth, gigantic antlers, and other remains of extinct races of
animals, which through untold ages have been hidden from sight.</p>

<p>Our views of Belvoir, we may add, are engraved from photographs,
taken specially for the purpose, by Mr. R. Keene, and by Mr. George
Green.</p>

<p>Bottesford Church, a fine structure of the Perpendicular period, with a
lofty crocketed spire, is mainly interesting as being the resting-place for several
of the old monuments of the successive owners of Belvoir, removed hither
from the priories of Belvoir and Croxton, and as the burial-place of several
generations of the family of Manners. The earliest of the monuments is one
which has been variously ascribed to Robert de Todeni and the third William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1031" id="Page_1031">[1031]</a></span>
de Albini: if to either, it most probably commemorates the latter of these.
Other early monuments are to members of the De Ros family. Among these
are William de Ros, 1414; Margaret, his wife; and John, Lord Ros. Among
the monuments of the Manners family are those of Thomas, first Earl of
Rutland, and his countess, 1543; Henry, Earl of Rutland, and Margaret, his
countess, 1563; Edward, third Earl of Rutland, 1587; John, fourth Earl of
Rutland, 1588; Roger, fifth Earl of Rutland, 1612; Francis, sixth Earl of
Rutland (and his “two sonnes, both which dyed in their infancy, by wicked
practice and sorcerye”), 1632; George, seventh Earl of Rutland, 1641; John,
eighth Earl of Rutland, and his countess, 1670; and others.</p>

<p class="dc13 p4">TRENTHAM, the magnificent
seat of his Grace the Duke
of Sutherland, is beautifully
situated not far from the rise
of the river Trent, in one of the most
charming parts of Staffordshire. Its
nearest town is Newcastle-under-Lyme,
closely adjacent to the most
important centre of British industry,
the Pottery district, rendered famous
in the world of commerce by its vast
productions, which supply every civilised
country, and in the world of Art
by the “things of beauty” produced
by its matchless artists, and which
will literally remain a “joy for ever,”
in whatever place they may be preserved.</p>

<p>The history of Trentham is not one that requires
much attention, for, unlike many other places, it has
had no stirring historical incidents connected with it,
and its story is therefore one of peace. Its vicissitudes have not been
unpleasant ones, not one scene of rapine or war or murder being recorded
in its annals; and it has become the “home”&mdash;literally the most charming
and comfortable of English homes&mdash;of one of our greatest nobles, where
domestic comforts take the place of state and ceremony, and homelike
surroundings supplant unmeaning grandeur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1033" id="Page_1033">[1033]</a></span></p>

<p>Trentham Monastery was, it is stated, founded by Ethelred, who succeeded
his brother Wulphere as King of Mercia in 675, and who induced
his niece Werburgh (daughter of Wulphere) “to leave the religious house
at Ely, where she was abbess, to superintend the nunnery he had built at
Trentham, as well as other similar religious foundations in Mercia&mdash;viz.
Hanbury, near Burton-on-Trent; Repton (the capital of the Mercian kingdom),
in Derbyshire; and Weedon, in Northamptonshire. Werburgh died
at Trentham, after leading a long and pious and eminently useful life, and,
being shortly afterwards canonised, became one of the most celebrated of
Anglo-Saxon saints. It is supposed that the original site of St. Werburgh’s
Nunnery was at Hanchurch, about a mile from Trentham, the spot being
marked by some venerable yews of great antiquity, which still form three
sides of a square. It was called Tricengham, and is by that name described
by Tanner, Dugdale, and others.</p>

<p>There is no record for the next four hundred years; but in the Domesday
survey a priest is mentioned as being there. In the time of William Rufus
(1027 to 1100), the priory having been restored or rebuilt by the Earl of
Chester, “the prior and canons entered upon Trentham by a deed of gift
from Hugh, first Earl of Chester; and a deed of institution by Roger de
Clinton, Bishop of Lichfield (1139), describes John, the prior, as instituted
to the priory of Trentham and its appendages, on the presentation of the
Empress Maude, at a synod held at Lichfield.” The building appears to
have been continued by the fourth Earl of Chester, as the charter, commonly
known as the deed of “Restoration,” is that of Randle, the fourth earl
(about 1152). It is the remains of this building which have furnished the
fine Norman pillars of the present church. In 1162 the church of Sutton-en-le-Felde,
in Derbyshire, was given to Trentham by Ralph de Boscherville.
The chapelries of Whitmore and Newcastle also belonged to it; and
soon after this date Hugh Kyveliok, Earl of Chester, gave to it the church
of Bettesford. In the next century Clayton Griffith became an appanage of
the priory, as did Over-Elkiston. In 1321 the advowson was claimed by the
Earl of Lancaster, who instituted a prior (Richard of Dilhorne), whose
election was afterwards confirmed by the King.</p>

<p>Early in the reign of Henry VI. the priory obtained from the King in very
express terms a confirmation and enlargement of former grants. After
reciting the original deeds of gift of Henry II. and Randolph, Earl of
Chester, the King bestows on “my Canons of Trentham” “Crofts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1034" id="Page_1034">[1034]</a></span>
cultivation, and all other lands belonging to the manor (<i>in malo territoris</i>),
and the two moores on either side of the village between the wood and the
river of Trentham for the purpose of being made into meadow land for the
maintenance of the brotherhood and of the hospitalities of the house....
And forbid any man to sue them at law in opposition to this deed, except in
my own court.” Given at Dover, 23rd of May, 6th Henry VI. In the latter
part of this deed the prior is described as abbot. The <i>territorium</i> which
was to be taken into cultivation appears to have been the land extending
from the King’s Wood and the High Greaves, and North Wood down to the
river. The field lying on the sloping ground between the farmhouse of
North Wood and the river is still called the Prior’s More, or Moor.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the monasteries in 1531, the priory of Trentham
(whose last prior was Thomas Bradwell, who, elected 22nd Henry VIII.,
held office at the time), whose annual value was returned at £106 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
clear, was granted, in 1539, to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk,
brother-in-law to Henry VIII., and afterwards came into the possession of
the Levesons, a Staffordshire family of great antiquity seated at Willenhall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1035" id="Page_1035">[1035]</a></span>
Nicholas Leveson, Lord Mayor of London, died in the year that Trentham
was granted to the Duke of Suffolk. His great-grandson, Sir John
Leveson, left two daughters only, his co-heiresses, one of whom, Frances,
by marrying Sir Thomas Gower of Sittenham, carried Trentham and other
extensive possessions into this ancient Yorkshire family, which dates from
the Conquest.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Leveson was distinguished as a naval commander. He is
considered to be the subject of the fine old plaintive ballad “The Spanish
Lady’s Love,” although the same honour has been ascribed to Sir John
Bolle, for he accompanied the Earl of Nottingham in his expedition against
Cadiz when he was twenty-seven years of age. The ballad, one of the best
in our language, tells the story of a “Spanish lady” “by birth and parentage
of high degree,” who, being detained as a prisoner by the English
captain, was so overcome with his kindness that she conceived a violent
attachment towards him; so much so, indeed, that when&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp7q p1">“... At last there came commandment</p>
<p class="pp8">For to set the ladies free,</p>
<p class="pp7">With all their jewels still adornéd,</p>
<p class="pp8">None to do them injury;</p>
<p class="pp6">Then said this lady gay, ‘Full woe is me!<br />
O, let me still sustain this kind captivity!</p>

<p class="ls2 pi6">*****</p>

<p class="pp6">Thou hast set this present day my body free,<br />
But my heart in prison strong remains with thee.’”</p>

<p class="pn1">The captain urged many objections, each one of which in turn she argued
away and removed, even when he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp7q p1">“I have neither gold nor silver</p>
<p class="pp8">To maintain thee in this case,</p>
<p class="pp7">And to travel is great charges</p>
<p class="pp8">As you know in every place.”</p>

<p class="pn1">She answered&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“My chains and jewels every one shall be thine own,<br />
And the five hundred pounds in gold that lies unknown.”</p>

<p class="pn1">At length, finding all other argument useless, he is made boldly to
declare&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp7q p1">“I in England have already</p>
<p class="pp8">A sweet woman to my wife;</p>
<p class="pp6">I will not falsify my vow for gold or gain,<br />
Nor yet for all the fairest dames that live in Spain.”</p>

<p class="pn1">To which she makes him the magnanimous answer&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp7q p1">“Oh! how happy is that woman</p>
<p class="pp8">That enjoys so true a friend!</p>
<p class="pp7">Many happy days God send her!</p>

<p class="pn1">And she, taking an affecting leave of him, declares her intention of spending
her days in prayer in a nunnery. Sir Richard married the daughter of the
famous Earl of Nottingham, who was Lord High Admiral and Commander-in-chief
of the fleet which defeated
the Armada. Sir Richard Leveson,
who was in this engagement, was, in
1601, made Vice-Admiral, and died in
1605. In the collegiate church at Wolverhampton
was formerly a “stately
monument in black marble erected to
his memory, by which were two brass
plates, the one inscribed with the chief
events of his life, registered at length
in Latin,” and the other in English,
erected by Sir Richard Leveson. It
was executed by Le Sueur for £300,
the original contract being still preserved
at Trentham. During the civil
wars “this bronze effigy was ordered
by the Committee of Sequestrations at
Stafford to be taken away and cast
into cannon; but by the timely interposition
of Lady Leveson, the
Admiral’s widow, it was redeemed for
a sum of money, and deposited in
Lilleshall Church till the strife was
over. The marble monument being
destroyed, it now occupies a niche in
the church of Wolverhampton,” and a copy is preserved in a recess in the
court-yard at Trentham.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Leveson, Knight of the Bath, M.P. for Shropshire, and
afterwards for Newcastle-under-Lyme, was devoted to the cause of Charles I.
He made his residence at Trentham, “being accounted one of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1037" id="Page_1037">[1037]</a></span>
housekeepers and landlords in the county. In consequence of his adherence to
the royal cause, his property was sequestrated, for which he compounded by
the payment of more than £6,000&mdash;the largest composition obtained. A letter
of his to the Governor of Shrewsbury strikingly indicates the distresses
sustained even by persons of distinction during those troubled times:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">The Sir Richard Leveson who built the old hall at Trentham in 1633 (two
views of which are given in Plot) died in 1661. His widow, Lady Katharine
Leveson (daughter of Robert, Duke of Northumberland, and Lady Alice
Dudley), was a great benefactress to the parish. She died at Trentham in
1674, and was buried at Lilleshall. Her charities were almost boundless.
Sir Richard Leveson dying without issue, the Trentham estates passed to his
sister and co-heiress, who had married Sir Thomas Gower, and in the Gower
family they have remained to this day. Sir William Leveson-Gower, his
second son, who inherited the estates on the deaths of his elder brother and
nephew, married Lady Jane Granville, eldest daughter of the Earl of Bath,
by whom he had issue, with others, Sir John Leveson-Gower, who in 1703
was created Baron Gower of Sittenham. He married Catherine, daughter of
the first Duke of Rutland, by whom he had four sons and two daughters.
The eldest of these sons, John, was in 1746 advanced to the dignity of
Viscount Trentham and Earl Gower. He was married three times: first, to
Evelyn, daughter of the Duke of Kingston, by whom he had four sons and
seven daughters; secondly, to Penelope, daughter of Sir John Stonehouse,
by whom he had one daughter; and, thirdly, to Lady Mary Tufton, daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1038" id="Page_1038">[1038]</a></span>
of the Earl of Thanet, by whom he had three sons and one daughter,
one of whom was the famed Admiral John Leveson-Gower. His lordship
was succeeded by his third son by his first wife, Granville Leveson
Gower, who in 1786 was raised to the dignity of Marquis of Stafford.
He married three times: first, Elizabeth Fazakerly, by whom he had
a son, who died in infancy; second, Lady Louisa Egerton, daughter
of the first Duke of Bridgewater, by whom he had issue a son, George
Granville, who succeeded him, and three daughters (Lady Louisa,
married to Sir Archibald Macdonald; Lady Caroline, married to Frederick,
Earl of Carlisle; and Lady Anne, married to Edward Vernon Harcourt,
Archbishop of York); third, Lady Susan Stewart, daughter of the Earl of
Galloway, by whom he had issue one son, Granville Leveson-Gower, created
Baron Leveson of Stone, and Viscount and Earl Granville (who married Lady
Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish, daughter of the fifth Duke of Devonshire, and
was father of the present eminent statesman, Earl Granville), and three
daughters&mdash;viz. Lady Georgiana Augusta, married to the Earl of St. Germains;
Lady Charlotte Sophia, married to the Duke of Beaufort; and Lady
Susanna, married to the Earl of Harrowby. The Marquis, who held many
important public offices, died in 1803, and was succeeded by his eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>George Granville Leveson-Gower, as second Marquis of Stafford. This
nobleman married, in 1785, Elizabeth, Countess of Sutherland and Baroness
Strathnaver (a title dating from 1228), and was, in 1833, advanced to the
dignity of Duke of Sutherland. His grace, who had been called to the Upper
House during his father’s lifetime as Baron Gower, became heir to the Duke
of Bridgewater, and thus added immense wealth to the family property. He
had surviving issue two sons&mdash;viz. George Granville, by whom he was succeeded,
and Lord Francis, who took the name and arms of Egerton, by sign-manual,
in 1833, and was raised to the peerage as Earl of Ellesmere in 1846
(he married Harriet Catherine, eldest daughter of Charles Greville, Esq., by
whom he had issue, with others, the second Earl of Ellesmere, and Admiral
Egerton, who married Lady Louisa Cavendish, daughter of the present Duke
of Devonshire)&mdash;and two daughters, viz. Lady Charlotte Sophia, married to
the Duke of Norfolk; and Lady Elizabeth Mary, married to Richard, Marquis
of Westminster, father of the present Duke of Westminster.</p>

<p>A noble colossal bronze statue of the Duke (who died in 1833), the figure
being sixteen feet in height, and placed on a lofty column on Tittensor Hill
(called “Monument Hill”), forms a conspicuous object against the sky from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1039" id="Page_1039">[1039]</a></span>
the house and gardens of Trentham. It is one of Chantrey’s masterpieces of
Art. The column, base, and steps were designed by Barry. The entire
height is fifty-nine feet, including the figure. It bears the following
appropriate inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">George Granville Leveson-Gower, second Duke of Sutherland, was called
to the Upper House during his father’s lifetime as Baron Gower. He was
born in 1786, and married, in 1823, the Lady Harriet Elizabeth Georgiana
Howard, daughter of the Earl of Carlisle. By this happy union his grace
had issue four sons and seven daughters. Among these were&mdash;the present
Duke of Sutherland, of whom more presently; Lord Albert Sutherland
Leveson-Gower, who married, in 1872, a daughter of Sir Thomas Nevill
Abdy, Bart., and died in 1874, leaving issue one infant; Lord Ronald
Charles Leveson-Gower, late M.P. for Sutherland; Lady Elizabeth
Georgiana, married, in 1844, to the present Duke of Argyll, and is
mother of the Marquis of Lorne; Lady Evelyn, married to Lord Blantyre;
Lady Caroline, married to the Duke of Leinster; and Lady Constance
Gertrude, married to the present Duke of Westminster. His Grace the
Duke of Sutherland died in 1861, aged seventy-four, and was buried in
the Mausoleum at Trentham. He was a man of liberal, kindly, gentle,
and benevolent disposition, and was beloved by people of every class;
indeed, such was the affectionate attachment of his tenants, that after his
death they erected statues to his memory on most of his estates.</p>

</div>

<p>The Duchess, whose refined taste, attachment to Art, amiability of disposition,
winning manners, and energetic character were beyond praise, died
in 1868, and was also buried in the mausoleum at Trentham. She was
Mistress of the Robes to the Queen, by whom she was esteemed as a beloved
friend. To her pure taste Trentham owes many of its most attractive
features, and had she lived to carry out the full bent of her inclination, much
more would have been accomplished. A chastely beautiful altar-tomb, with
a recumbent effigy of the Duchess, by Noble, has been erected in Trentham
Church, and is one of the highest and purest achievements of sculptural Art.
“Recurring to the monument in Trentham Church,” says the Rev. Prebendary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1041" id="Page_1041">[1041]</a></span>
Edwards, “it tells us, though in silence, of a rare combination of
affection, thought, and artistic skill in all who have been engaged upon it.
It could not have been confided to better hands than Mr. Noble’s, who, as
sculptor, has had his heart in his work. Resting in calm and the deepest
repose, as between life and death, the figure recalls with wonderful truth the
beauty of feature and gentleness of expression of her whom it represents.”
The monument is placed at the east end of the south aisle, and the sculptor
has been happy in finding a spot for his marble where the light of a south
window falls on the countenance of the figure on the tomb beneath. The
floor is laid with encaustic tiles, bearing the arms of the family and the
initials of the deceased. The monument contains the following inscription,
written by Mr. Gladstone:&mdash;</p>

<p>The old hall at Trentham, previously referred to, and which was usually
called Trentham Priory, through having been built on the foundations of
that religious house, was altered and enlarged, and in the main rebuilt,
by the second duke. The work was intrusted to Sir Charles Barry, and
was commenced in 1834, and carried out at a cost of about £150,000. It
had, however, previously undergone much alteration at the hands of Mr.
Tatham, who endeavoured to approximate it, in appearance, to the old
Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p class="dc13 p1">PURSUING the carriage-way to Trentham,
the visitor passes to the house
from the park through a pair of
gates, the posts of which are surmounted
with life-size bronze stags. In the
centre of the circular drive is a fine
bronze statue of Diana at the chase.
The carriage porch, which, unlike the
rest of the building, is of solid stone,
forms a square, arched upon columns,
with an entablature and attic surmounted
with a balustrade, and piers
and bases. Over the arches are the
arms of the Duke, boldly carved in
stone; the supporters, wolves, as large
as life. From this porch the entrance door opens into an
elegant semicircular corridor, which is one of the prettiest
features of the place. To the left, on entering, the corridor
leads to the Entrance Hall, Grand Staircase, Billiard, and other
rooms; and, on the right, to the Private Conservatory, Drawing-room, the
private rooms, &amp;c.; while in front it encloses the West Court, with its shell-fountain,
statue of “Venus rising from the Bath,” and other attractions.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to minutely describe the various rooms of this charming
and purely domestic “Home,” nor to observe any consecutive arrangement
regarding those upon which we may remark. All we need do is to briefly
allude to some of the apartments, and then pass on to the charming grounds&mdash;the
glory of Trentham.</p>

<p>Among the more notable rooms are the following:&mdash;The Venetian Room,
or the Duchess’s Boudoir, is, without exception, the most perfect gem of a
room which any mansion can boast. It, as well as the Duke’s Room and
Private Dining-room, opens from the corridor to the private rooms, lined with
presses of books, and is lighted by three windows in the south front. The
walls are divided into five large panels, painted by Clarkson Stanfield, in his
best and most brilliant style, with scenes in Venice; the panels being
separated from each other, and surrounded by gilt reticulated work on a
crimson velvet ground. Of the furnishing and decorations of this exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1045" id="Page_1045">[1045]</a></span>
apartment it is enough to say that it is arranged with that refined and
faultlessly pure taste, which can nowhere be expected to be better shown than
in the surroundings of so good and amiable and accomplished a woman as
the Duchess of Sutherland.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The South Front, with Grecian Temple.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Duke’s Room closely adjoins this apartment. It is fitted with presses
filled with the choicest and most rare printed books and manuscripts, and
contains some remarkably fine paintings. Among the literary treasures here
preserved we cannot forbear noting the original manuscript of old John
Gower’s poems, in his own handwriting, and, as shown by an inscription at
the commencement, presented by the poet to King Henry IV., on his coronation,
and given back to the family of Gower, some centuries later, by Sir
Thomas Fairfax; and among the treasures of Art, of which there are many,
is one of the original “first fifty” copies of the Portland vase by old Josiah
Wedgwood, in perfect preservation. And here it may be well to note that
through the kind thoughtfulness of the Duke on our visit, we were shown a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1046" id="Page_1046">[1046]</a></span>
fine and remarkably interesting old Wedgwood jasper chimney-piece in the
Bath-room; it is one of the best remaining specimens. Adjoining the
Venetian Room, on the other side, is the Private Dining-room, the walls of
which are hung with a fine collection of landscapes by Penry Williams, and
paintings by other artists. Leading to the corridor, at one end, is the
Private Arcade, at the extremity of which, next to the Duke’s Room, has
recently been placed Noble’s magnificent statue of the late duke&mdash;a work of
Art which takes rank with any of that eminent sculptor’s productions.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Conservatory and Private Wing, South Front.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Dining-room, at the east end of the south terrace, contains some
choice sculpture by Antonio Sola, Wolff, and others, and some gigantic vases
of Minton’s creation. Adjoining this is the Marble Hall, or Ante Dining-room,
lighted from the ceiling, and containing, besides a fine sculptured
figure of Canning&mdash;copied from that by Chantrey in Westminster Abbey&mdash;a
full-length life-size portrait of the late Harriet, Duchess of Sutherland, by
Winterhalter. The Breakfast-room, among its other pictorial treasures, contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1047" id="Page_1047">[1047]</a></span>
Wilkie’s “Breakfast,” painted for the first duke; Gainsborough’s
“Landscape with Sheep;” Jackson’s “Infant Moses,” exhibited in 1818;
Callcott’s “Italian Landscape,” and other paintings by Poussin, Stothard,
Moulson, Frearson, Rogers, Wilson, &amp;c.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Private Conservatory.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Library, which contains a marvellous collection of choice and valuable
books, is enriched by a frieze from the Elgin and Phigalean marbles, and is a
charming and highly interesting room. In the Saloon, or Music-room, a
pretty apartment whose ceiling is supported on pilasters, are some exquisite
family busts, a charming bust of the late duchess by Noble, and other attractions.
The carpet is characterized by the same pattern as the terrace garden.
The Drawing-room, with its sweetly pretty painted ceiling, contains many
good pictures: among these are Hofland’s “Storm off the Coast at Scarborough;”
Sir Thomas Lawrence’s portraits of Lord Francis Leveson-Gower
(Egerton), and of the second Duke of Sutherland; Vandyke’s “Children of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1048" id="Page_1048">[1048]</a></span>
Charles I.;” Charles Landseer’s “Benediction,” and others. The Billiard-room
has a lofty coved ceiling, and was the Great Hall of the old mansion. In
it are Winterhalter’s grand full-length figure of Queen Victoria, presented by
her Majesty to the late duchess; a copy of Reynolds’s portrait of George III.;
Romney’s portrait of Queen Charlotte, Lord Chancellor Thurlow, and the first
Marquis of Stafford, and others.</p>

<p>In the Entrance Hall is a copy of Michael Angelo’s statue of “Thought;”
and on the Grand Staircase is a rich assemblage of family and other portraits.
In the various bed-rooms and other apartments, too, are contained a vast
number of valuable paintings and works of Art.</p>

<p>The Private Conservatory, however, is one of the “gems” of Trentham,
and is as elegant in its arrangements and decorations as the most fastidious
taste can desire or Art accomplish. Of this miniature “world of flowers”
we give an engraving, from a special photograph taken by Harrison, but of
its Eastern splendour of rich colours we can offer no idea. It is a square
apartment, with Italian windows and trellised walls, and is also trellised
between the lights of the ceiling. In the centre is a fine figure of “Venus at
the Bath.” The noble ferns and the exotic and other plants are of the choicest
kinds, and the arrangement of colour, especially when all are lighted from
the number of lamps suspended from the roof, is exquisitely beautiful.</p>

<p>A pleasant feature of Trentham is the Bowling Alley&mdash;formerly the
Orangery Arcade&mdash;which affords an almost unique and very pleasing indoor
pastime for the family and friends. This feature, we believe, was much
enjoyed by the Shah on his visit to Trentham, which was rendered lavishly
enjoyable to him in every conceivable way.</p>

<p>From the Entrance Hall a doorway opens into the Church, which thus
becomes not only the parish church, but the private chapel of the Duke. The
Church thus forms a part of, or at all events is attached to, the house; and
the transition from the elegances of modern life to the grand old house of
prayer is very striking and solemn. The Church, which was restored in 1842
at the cost of the Duke, by Sir Charles Barry, is the nave of the old abbey of
Trentham, the chancel having extended considerably beyond the present east
wall of the churchyard. The Church, as it now exists, consists of a nave with
clerestory, north and south aisles, and chancel, with a mortuary chapel at the
east end of the south aisle. The pillars which divide the aisles from the nave are
Norman, and are the original pillars, carefully replaced and restored, of the old
priory; from them now spring acutely pointed arches of a later, and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1049" id="Page_1049">[1049]</a></span>
incongruous, character. The chancel is divided from the nave by an
elaborate oak screen of late but good character, the altar-piece, by Hilton, being
the “Taking down from the Cross.” There is an eagle lectern at the east end of
the nave; and the pulpit is hung with a fine Moorish horsecloth, elaborately
worked in silver on crimson velvet. At the west end is a gallery forming the
family pew. At the back of this, beneath the window, is a bust of the late
duke; on the south side, a bust, by Noble, of a son of the present duke, who
died young; and, on the north side, a tablet to Lord Frederick Leveson-Gower,
who lost his life during the Crimean war. At the same end of the
Church is a poor’s box, bearing date 1698. The font, the gift of the
parishioners, is also at the west end.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Trentham Church.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the Memorial Chapel, besides the exquisitely beautiful altar-tomb to
the late duchess by Noble, to which we have already referred, are monuments
and tablets to the Levesons and Gowers; and here, too, is placed a
memorial bust to Lord Albert, recently deceased. Of the beautiful monument
to the late duchess we have given an engraving on page 40, copied from a
clever photograph by M. De Tejada, taken from the admirable picture by
Mr. John O’Connor, painted, we believe, for Lord Ronald Gower, and in his
lordship’s possession. In the north wall of the Church is a recessed arched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1050" id="Page_1050">[1050]</a></span>
tomb, on which lie the fragments of a highly interesting effigy in chain-mail,
dug up in the churchyard a few years ago; and over the north door
are the royal arms, dated 1663, pierced with Parliamentarian bullets.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>One feature yet remains to be noted; it is the introduction on the north
wall of encaustic wall-tiles, each one of which, enclosed in a reticulated
pattern, bears a memorial of some departed parishioner, in manner
following:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>These, which are many in number, are arranged above the oak lining on
the seats, and have appropriate texts, &amp;c., also in tiles, running above and
below the series. It is a pretty and very lasting, as well as inexpensive,
kind of memorial, and one that might with advantage be adopted in many
churches. In the churchyard are the remains of a cross, and some other
interesting matters.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Upper Terrace Garden, Italian Garden, and Lake.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The great features of Trentham are, as we have before said, its grounds
and its matchless lake. To these, however, we have but little space to
devote, though a bare enumeration of their points of beauty would fill a
volume. To the park the public are, thanks to the liberality of the Duke of
Sutherland, and which is one of the innate features of himself and the noble
family of which he is the head, freely admitted. The gardens and pleasure-grounds
(which, until the great alterations made some years ago, was simply
a sheep pasture railed off from the park) can only, however, and very
rightly, be seen by special permission. To these we must devote a few
words. The principal or south front of the house&mdash;two charming views
of which we have given on pages 45 and 46&mdash;looks across the grounds
and lake to the distant wooded hills skirting the horizon, and crowned
in one place by the colossal statue of the first duke, to which we have
already alluded. A part of this view, as seen from the windows of
this front, we have depicted in the accompanying engraving. First
comes the Terrace (not included in our view), studded with statues and
vases; next, the Terrace Garden, with its central fountain, its grand
bronze vases and sculptures, its flower-beds laid out in the form of a
letter S for Sutherland, its recessed alcoves, and its Grecian temples,
containing marvellous examples of antique sculpture; next, beyond, come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1052" id="Page_1052">[1052]</a></span>
the Italian Gardens (approached by a fine semicircular flight of steps),
about ten acres in extent, with their parterres and borders and sunk
beds, their statues, fountain, and busts, and their thousand and one other
attractions; then the Lake Terrace, with its balustrade, its line of vases,
its magnificent colossal statue of “Perseus and Medusa” (which cost its
noble owner £1,600), its descending steps for landing, its boat-houses, and
other appliances; then, next beyond, the Lake, eighty-three acres in extent,
on which sailing and rowing boats and canoes find ample space for aquatic
exercise; then the Islands&mdash;one of which alone is four acres in extent, and
the other a single acre&mdash;beautifully planted with trees and shrubs; and,
beyond this again, the woods of Tittensor, with the crowning monument.
To the left are the grand wooded heights of King’s Wood Bank, a part of
the ancient forest of Needwood, and consequently the remains of the old
hunting-grounds of the Kings of Mercia; and, to the right, the American
Grounds, planted with a profusion of rhododendrons and other appropriate
shrubs and plants; while the Italian Garden is skirted on its east side by a
deliciously cool and shady trellised walk&mdash;a floral tunnel, so to speak,
some two hundred yards long, formed of trellised arches the whole of its
length, overgrown with creeping plants and flowers, and decorated with
busts, ornamental baskets, &amp;c., forming a vista of extreme loveliness.</p>

<p>Near this is a pleasant glade, having the Orangery, now the Bowling
Alley, at its extremity; and near here is the iron bridge&mdash;one hundred
and thirty years old, and one of the <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i> of the old Coalbrookdale
Works&mdash;crossing the river Trent, which flows through the grounds.
Standing on this bridge, the view both up and down the Trent is strikingly
beautiful. Looking up the stream, the “solemn Trent” is seen crossed
by the old stone bridge, while, to the left, a view of the house is partially
obtained through the trees, the original course of the river, before it was
altered, being distinctly traceable, and presenting a broader surface and
a more graceful sweep than at present. Looking down the stream, the
view is more charming still, and embraces the river, the lake (into which,
until a few years back, the Trent flowed), the islands, the American and
other gardens, and the wooded heights that skirt the domain.</p>

<p>Crossing the bridge, a little to the right is the Conservatory, filled with
the choicest trees and flowering plants, and kept, as all the rest of the
gardens and grounds are, in the most perfect order. In front of this
Conservatory is a pretty feature&mdash;the poetical idea of the late duchess&mdash;consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1053" id="Page_1053">[1053]</a></span>
of the names of her daughters (the sisters of the present Duke
of Sutherland) planted in box on a ground of white spar. The words as
they appear are&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">ELIZABETH LORNE.<br />

<p class="pn1">Thus the “memory” of the four daughters of the late duchess&mdash;viz. the

and the Duchess of Westminster&mdash;is kept “ever green.”</p>

<p>Near by are the Kitchen Gardens, Conservatories, Vineries, Peach-houses,
Pine-houses, Orchid-houses, and all the usual appliances of a large and

Kitchen Gardens, some thirteen acres in extent, is carried what is known
as the Trentham Wall-Case&mdash;a glass-sided and covered passage, filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1054" id="Page_1054">[1054]</a></span>
with peaches and nectarines, and forming an enclosed walk all round the
place. Near the garden entrance is the pleasant residence of the head-gardener,
shown in the preceding engraving. It was erected from the designs
of Sir Charles Barry; and near it is another excellent building, a “bothie”
for the young gardeners, erected from the designs of Mr. Roberts, the Duke’s
architect and surveyor at Trentham. In this cottage the young gardeners,
several in number, board and lodge, and have a reading-room, healthful
and amusing games, and other comforts provided for them. The Children’s
Cottage, with the grounds around, is also a pretty little spot, and, indeed,
the whole of the grounds are one unbroken succession of beauties.</p>

<p class="dc19">KNOLE HOUSE adjoins the pleasant and picturesque
town of Sevenoaks, in the fertile and
beautiful county of Kent&mdash;the “garden of
England”&mdash;and is situate in its most charming
and productive district, neighbouring the renowned
Wealds, and distant but an hour
from the metropolis of England.</p>

<p>The principal approach to the mansion is by a
long and winding avenue of finely grown beech-trees,
through the extensive park&mdash;the road sloping
and rising gradually, and presenting frequent views
of hill and dale&mdash;terminated by the heavy and
sombre stone front of the ancient and venerable
edifice. Passing under an embattled tower, the
first or outer quadrangle is entered; hence there
is another passage through another tower-portal,
which conducts to the inner quadrangle, and so to
the</p>

<p class="pp18 p1">“Huge hall, long galleries, spacious chambers,”</p>

<p class="pn1">for which Knole has long been famous.</p>

<p>Of Knole, as with most of our grand old mansions,
it is impossible to fix, with any degree of certainty, the date of its
original foundation; “but the evident connection between the several properties
of Knole and Sevenoaks with Kemsing, Otford, and Seale, coupled
with the gifts of certain lands in Kemsing to the royal abbey at Wilton,
appears to identify those manors with the <i>terra regia</i> of the Saxon Kings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1057" id="Page_1057">[1057]</a></span>
Kent, who had, it is supposed, one of their palaces at Otford, to which place
Sevenoaks and Knole have always been esteemed appendant, and were for
some time after Domesday survey held by the same owners.” Early in the
reign of King John, the manor and estates of Knole, with those of Braborne
(Bradborne), Kemsing, and Seale, were held by Baldwin de Bethun, or
Betune, Earl of Albemarle.</p>

<p>The first Earl of Albemarle was Odo, Count of Champaigne, a near
relative by birth to William the Conqueror, and the husband of his sister,
Adeliza. He was succeeded by his son, surnamed <i>Le Gros</i>, who was also
made Earl of Yorkshire. This nobleman appears to have had an only child,
a daughter named Hawise, who espoused William Mandeville, Earl of Essex,
who, on her father’s death in 1179, succeeded to the title and estates.
After his death without issue, his widow, Hawise, married William de
Fortibus, who enjoyed the title, as did also her third husband, Baldwin de
Betune, or Bethun. On his death the earldom reverted to William de
Fortibus, the son of Hawise by her second husband.</p>

<p>In the fifth year of King John, Baldwin de Betune gave the manors of
Knole, Sevenoaks, Bradborne, Kemsing, and Seale in “frank marriage”
with his daughter Alice, on her marriage to William Mareschal, Earl of Pembroke,
who was succeeded by his brother, who, being attainted, the lands were
escheated to the Crown. These manors were next, it is said, given to Fulk
de Brent; but he having been banished the realm, they again reverted to the
Crown, and, the family having returned to allegiance, the lands were restored
to them, and the Earl’s brothers&mdash;Gilbert, Walter, and Anselme&mdash;successively
became Earls of Pembroke and Lords-Marshal. These earls having all died
without issue, the estates “devolved on their sisters, in consequence of which
Roger, son of Hugh Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, who married Maud, the eldest
sister, became entitled, and died seized of these estates about 54 Henry III.,
without issue, leaving Roger Bigod, his nephew, his next heir, who, in
the 11th of Edward I., conveyed them to Otho de Grandison, who, dying
without issue, was succeeded by his brother, William de Grandison; and his
grandson, Sir Thomas de Grandison, according to Philpot, transferred Knole
to Geoffrey de Say, and the rest of the estates to other hands.”</p>

<p>Geoffrey de Say was summoned to Parliament by Edward III.; was
Admiral of the King’s Fleet, and a knight-banneret; and distinguished himself
in the wars with France and Flanders. He married Maud, daughter of
Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, by whom he left issue William, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1058" id="Page_1058">[1058]</a></span>
son and heir, and three daughters, who eventually became co-heiresses “to
this property, which continued in the family till the reign of Henry VI.,
when one Ralph Leghe conveyed the whole estate by sale to James Fiennes,”
the grandson of the youngest of the three co-heiresses.</p>.

<p>James Fiennes, who had distinguished himself in the wars with France
in the reign of Henry V., was created Lord Say and Sele. The Fiennes were
an ancient family, descended from John, Baron of Fiennes, Hereditary Constable
of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports, who was father of
James, and he of John, who had issue Ingelram de Fiennes, who was slain
at Acon, in the Holy Land, in 1190. “He married Sybil de Tyngrie,
daughter and heiress to Erasmus de Bologne, nephew to Maud, Queen of
England, wife of King Stephen, from which match proceeded William de
Fiennes, who succeeded to the estates of the Earl of Bologne. He was succeeded
by his son Ingelram, whose son William was educated with Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1059" id="Page_1059">[1059]</a></span>
Edward, and was, in turn, succeeded by his son John, of whom no issue
remained. His uncle, Sir Giles Fiennes, succeeded. By his wife Sybil he
had issue John, his son and heir, and by Joan, his wife, had issue John de
Fiennes, who had to wife Maud, sister and heir of John Monceaux, of Hurst-Monceaux,
in Sussex; and dying, left issue Sir William Fiennes, Knt., who
having married Joan, youngest daughter to Geoffrey, Lord Say, and at length
co-heir to William, her brother, his posterity thereby shared in the inheritance
of that family, being succeeded by William, his son and heir.” He
married Elizabeth Battisford, by whom he had issue two sons, Roger and
James, the elder of whom left a son, Richard, who, marrying Joan, daughter
and heiress of Thomas, Lord Dacre, was declared Lord Dacre, and was
ancestor of that noble family.</p>

<p>James Fiennes, the second son, of whom we have already spoken as
having been called to Parliament as Lord Say and Sele, became Constable of
Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord Chamberlain to the
King, Constable of the Tower of London, and Lord Treasurer of England.
Such rapid advancement was, however, distasteful to the malcontents of this
kingdom; and the King, to appease them, sequestered Lord Say from his
office of Treasurer, and, as is supposed, to insure his safety from his enemies,
committed him to the Tower. The rebels, under Jack Cade, however, forced
the Tower, carried Lord Say to the Guildhall, and after a mock trial, hurried
him to the Standard in Cheapside, where “they cut off his head, and carried
it on a pole, causing his naked body to be drawn at a horse’s tail into Southwark,
to Sir Thomas of Waterings, and there hanged and quartered.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The murder of Lord Say took place July 4th, 29th Henry VI. He was
succeeded by his son, Sir William Fiennes (by his wife, Emeline Cromer),
who, suffering much in the Wars of the Roses, was compelled to part with the
greater portion of his estates and offices. His patent of Constable of Dover
Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports he assigned to Humphrey, Duke of
Buckingham, and the manor and estate of Knole he sold, in 1456, to Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1060" id="Page_1060">[1060]</a></span>
Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, for four hundred marks. After an eventful
life he was killed at the battle of Barnet, and the title died with him.
Archbishop Bourchier is said to have “rebuilt the manor-house, enclosed a
park around the same, and resided much at it.” At his death, in 1486, he
bequeathed the estate to the see of Canterbury. Archbishop Morton, who
was visited at Knole by King Henry VII., died there in 1500; and Archbishop
Wareham, who was frequently visited at Knole by Kings Henry VII.
and VIII., also died there. Archbishop Cranmer likewise resided here, and
he, by indenture dated November 30th, 29 Henry VIII., conveyed Knole and
other manors to the King and his successors, in whose hands it remained until
the reign of Edward VI., when that monarch, in his fourth year, granted it
by letters patent to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick (afterwards Duke of
Northumberland), on whose attainder and execution, in 1553, it again
reverted to the Crown.</p>

<p>Knole was next, by Queen Mary, granted to Cardinal Pole, then Archbishop
of Canterbury, for life. By Queen Elizabeth, in the third year of her
reign, it, with other estates, was granted to Sir Robert Dudley, afterwards
Earl of Leicester, but was again surrendered, a few years later, into the
hands of the Queen, who then granted it to Thomas Sackville, afterwards
Lord Buckhurst and Earl of Dorset.</p>

<p>It were indeed a long story to tell of all the famous deeds of the noble
family of Sackville, and one that would take more space than we can spare.
We therefore pass over the earlier members of the family, so as to reach
the first who owned Knole and its surroundings&mdash;Thomas Sackville, Lord
Buckhurst. He was the son of Richard Sackville, Lent Reader to
Henry VIII. and Treasurer to the Army of that monarch, by his first wife,
who was daughter of Sir John Bruges, Lord Mayor of London. When only
nineteen years of age he married Cicely, daughter of Sir John Baker, and
held many offices in the realm, being selected by the Queen, “by her particular
choice and liking, to a continual private attendance upon her own
person.” In 1567 he was created Baron Buckhurst. In 1571 he was sent
on a special mission to Charles IX. of France to negotiate the proposed
marriage of his royal mistress, Queen Elizabeth, with the Duke of Anjou;
and later on he was deputed to convey the sentence of her doom to Mary,
Queen of Scots. In 1587 he went on a mission to the Low Countries, and
figured prominently in almost all the incidents of the eventful period in
which he lived. After the death of Elizabeth, Lord Buckhurst was created,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1061" id="Page_1061">[1061]</a></span>
by James I., Earl of Dorset, and was continued in his office of Lord High
Treasurer of England. He died in 1608. Of his abilities as an author (for
he was one of the most brilliant of his age) Spenser wrote&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Whose learned muse hath writ her own record<br />
In golden verse, worthy immortal fame.”</p>

<p class="pn1">And this opinion is indorsed, not only by his contemporaries, but by people
of every age since his time. He is chiefly celebrated as the author of the
earliest English tragedy in blank verse, <i>Gordubuc</i>, and <i>The Induction to
a Mirrour for Magistrates</i>, one of the noblest poems in the language.
<i>Gordubuc</i> is praised by Sidney for its “notable moralitie,” and the poem is
believed to have given rise to the “Faery Queen.” All contemporaries
agree in bearing testimony to the virtues of this truly noble man. One of
them thus draws his character:&mdash;“How many rare things were in him! Who
more loving unto his wife? who more kind unto his children? who more
fast unto his friend? who more moderate unto his enemy? who more true
to his word?”</p>

<p>This nobleman was succeeded by his son Robert as second Earl of
Dorset, who died within a year of attaining to that dignity. He married, first,
Margaret, only daughter of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, and, second, Anne,
daughter of Sir George Spencer, and was succeeded by his second son of the
first marriage, Richard, as third Earl of Dorset. This nobleman&mdash;who was
notorious for the prodigal magnificence of his household, and had to sell
Knole to a Mr. Smith of Wandsworth&mdash;married, two days before his father’s
death, the famous Lady Ann Clifford, daughter of the Earl of Cumberland.
He was succeeded by his brother Edward Sackville, whose name is notorious
in history in the matter of his unfortunate and fatal duel with Lord Bruce,
of Kinloss. He married Mary, third daughter of Sir George Curzon, of
Croxhall, in Derbyshire, “to whose charge the instruction of the young
princess was committed by the unfortunate Charles, to whom the Earl and
Countess continued to the last to be most faithfully attached.” He was
succeeded by his son Richard as fifth Earl of Dorset, who married Lady
Frances Cranfield, daughter of Lionel, Earl of Middlesex, who repurchased
Knole of the trustees of Henry Smith, and was succeeded, as sixth earl, by
his son Charles, who had previously been created Baron Cranfield, and who
married, first, Elizabeth, daughter of Hervey Bagot and widow of the Earl
of Falmouth, and, second, Mary, daughter of James Compton, Earl of
Northampton, by whom he had a son, Lionel, who succeeded him, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1062" id="Page_1062">[1062]</a></span>
advanced to the dignity of Duke of Dorset, and made Constable of Dover
Castle, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Steward of England,
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord President of the Council, and held many
other offices, and took an active part in all affairs of the State.</p>

<p>He was succeeded,
as second Duke of Dorset, by his son Charles, who, among his other
offices, held that of Master of the Horse to Frederick, Prince of Wales. He
married Grace, daughter of Viscount Shannon, who was Mistress of the
Robes to Augusta, Princess of Wales, but had no issue. He was succeeded
in 1769 by his nephew, John Frederick, as third duke. He married, in
1790, Arabella Diana, daughter and heiress of Sir John Cope, by whom he
had issue George John Frederick (who succeeded him as fourth duke);
Mary, married to the Earl of Plymouth; and Elizabeth, married to Earl Delawarr.
The third duke died in 1799, his only son being at that time in his
sixth year. The Duchess, who married, secondly, Lord Whitworth, resided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1063" id="Page_1063">[1063]</a></span>
at Knole till her death in 1825; the fourth duke, her son, who had only
three months before attained his majority, being killed by a fall from his
horse in 1815. At his death Knole and some other estates passed to his
sister and co-heiress, the Lady Mary Sackville, who married first, in 1811,
Other Archer, sixth Earl of Plymouth, and, second, William Pitt, second
Baron and first Earl Amherst, but had no issue by either of those marriages.
Her ladyship died in 1864, and the estates then passed to her sister and
co-heiress, the Lady Elizabeth Sackville, created in 1864 the Baroness Buckhurst,
wife of the late George John Sackville-West, fifth Earl Delawarr,
with remainder to her second and younger sons, and was mother of the late
peer, Charles Richard, sixth Earl Delawarr; the present peer, the Right
Hon. Reginald Windsor Sackville-West, seventh Earl Delawarr and Baron
Buckhurst; the Hon. Mortimer Sackville-West, married to Charlotte,
daughter of Major-General William Dickson, and is a claimant for the
barony of Buckhurst, the present owner of Knole; the Hon. Lionel
Sackville-West; the Hon. William Edward Sackville-West, married to
Georgiana, daughter of George Dodwell, Esq.; the Lady Elizabeth,
married to the present Duke of Bedford; the Lady Mary Catherine,
married first, in 1847, to the second Marquis of Salisbury, and second, in
1870, to the fifteenth (present) Earl of Derby; and the Lady Arabella
Diana, married to Sir Alexander Bannerman, Bart.</p>

<p>The sixth Earl of Delawarr, Charles Richard Sackville-West, C.B., was
born in 1815, and succeeded his father in 1869; educated at Harrow, and
entered the 43rd Foot, 1833; Captain 21st Fusiliers, 1842; Major in the
army, 1846; Brevet-Colonel, 1850; Lieut.-Colonel and Colonel, 1854;
Major-General, 1864. His lordship, as Lord West, served in the Sutlej
campaign, 1845; was Aide-de-camp to Lord Gough at the battles of
Moodkee and Ferozeshah, and Military Secretary during the remainder
of the campaign; was present at Sobraon, and has received medal and
clasps; served in the Crimea, including the battles of the Alma and
Balaclava; commanded a detached wing of the 21st Fusiliers at the battle
of Inkermann, and also that regiment at Sebastopol. In the expedition to
Kinbourn he was in command of a brigade, and afterwards commanded one
at Shorncliffe Camp. His lordship was an Officer of the Legion of Honour,
a Knight of the Medjidie, &amp;c.</p>

<p>His lordship, who was unmarried, died, by his own hand, April 23rd,
1873, and was succeeded by his brother, the Hon. and Rev. R. W. Sackville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1064" id="Page_1064">[1064]</a></span></p>

<p>The present noble peer, the Hon. and Rev. Reginald Windsor Sackville,
seventh Earl Delawarr, Viscount Cantelupe, Baron Delawarr, Baron West,
and Baron Buckhurst, second son of the fifth Earl Delawarr, and brother of
the sixth earl, was born in 1817; was educated at Balliol College, Oxford,
where he proceeded B.A. in 1838, and M.A. in 1842; and became Rector of
Withyham, in Sussex. He assumed, in 1871, the surname of Sackville only,
in lieu of that of Sackville-West. His lordship married, in 1867, Constance
Mary Elizabeth, daughter of A. D. R. W. Baillie-Cochrane, Esq., M.P., by
whom he has issue living, the Hon. Lionel Charles Cranfield Sackville,
Viscount Cantelupe, born in 1868; the Hon. Gilbert George Reginald Sackville,
born in 1869; the Hon. Edeline Sackville, born in 1870; and the Hon.
Leonore Mary, born in 1872. His lordship is patron of six livings, four of
which are in Sussex and two in Oxfordshire.</p>

<p>The arms of Earl Delawarr are&mdash;quarterly, <i>or</i> and <i>gules</i>, a bend vaire,
<i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>. Crest&mdash;on a ducal coronet composed of fleurs-de-lis, as
estoile, <i>argent</i>, supporters on either side, a leopard, <i>argent</i>, spotted <i>sable</i>.
Motto&mdash;“Nunquam tentes aut perfice.” His seats are&mdash;Buckhurst, Tunbridge
Wells; and Bourn Hall, Cambridge.</p>

<p>The present owner of Knole is the Hon. Mortimer Sackville-West, son of
the fifth and brother of the sixth and seventh (present) Earl Delawarr, to
whom it passed on the demise of his mother, the Baroness Buckhurst, to
which title, now assumed by Earl Delawarr, he is a claimant. Mr. Sackville-West,
who was born in 1820, became Captain Grenadier Guards in 1845,
and is a Groom in Waiting in Ordinary to her Majesty. He married first,
in 1847, Fanny Charlotte, daughter of the late Major-General William
Dickson, C.B., E.I.C.S., of Beenham House, Berkshire, who died in 1870;
and second, in 1873, Elizabeth, second daughter of Charles Wilson Faber,
Esq.</p>

<p>Knole House is full of highly honourable and deeply interesting
associations with the past. Seen from a distance, the mansion appears
irregular; but, although the erection of several periods, and enlarged from
time to time to meet the wants and wishes of its immediate occupiers, it
exhibits few parts out of harmony with the whole, and presents a striking
and very imposing example of the earlier Baronial Mansion, such as it
was before settled peace in Britain warranted the withdrawal of all means
of defence in cases of attack from open or covert enemies. The neighbourhood,
as well as “the house,” is suggestive of many sad or pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1065" id="Page_1065">[1065]</a></span>
memories. From the summits of knolls, in the noble and well-stocked park,
extensive views are obtained of the adjacent country. Scattered about the
wealds of Kent are the tall spires of scores of village churches: Hever&mdash;recalling
the fate of the murdered Anne Boleyn and the destiny of the
deserted Anne of Cleves; Penshurst&mdash;the cradle and the tomb of the Sidneys;
Eridge&mdash;once great Warwick’s hunting-seat; the still frowning battlements
of Tunbridge Castle; these and other subjects within ken demand thought
and induce reflection, both of which obtain augmented power while treading
the graceful corridors and stately chambers of the time-honoured
mansion. The walls are hung with authentic portraits of the great men
of various epochs who, when living, flourished here; not alone the noble
and wealthy owners of the old hall, but the worthies who sojourned there as
guests, to have sheltered, aided, and befriended whom is now the proudest,
as it will be the most enduring, of all the boasts of lordly Knole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1066" id="Page_1066">[1066]</a></span></p>

<p>Visitors are generously admitted into the more interesting and attractive
of the apartments; and they are full of treasures of Art&mdash;not of paintings
alone, although of these every chamber is a storehouse, but of curious and
rare productions, from the most elaborate and costly examples of the artists
of the Middle Ages, to the characteristic works of the English artisan during
the reigns of Elizabeth and James, when a vast amount of labour was
bestowed upon the commonest articles of every-day use.</p>

<p>In the Porter’s Apartments, adjoining the entrance, is what may be
called the Retainers’ Armoury&mdash;an apartment lined with old flint and steel
muskets of formidable bore, cutlasses, skull-caps, and other warlike implements,
including some fine halberds. It is said that Cromwell, on taking
Knole House, carried away several waggon-loads of arms. Even now the
position is so strong, that a garrison of five hundred men, loopholing the
walls, and taking the defensive measures prescribed by the military science
of the day, would be able to make it a “tough job” to turn them out.
The curious brick loopholing of the wall of a large building, looking like a
barn, at the north-east corner of the pile, seems as if it had been prepared
for the use of archers. In a court-yard near, the wall has been raised, and
that at a period which is widely removed from the date of its erection.
In the lower and thicker portion is a window of the style introduced in
the reign of Henry III. Close by, in the upper and receding portion, is
an opening with the flat, four-centred arch of the Tudor times.</p>

<p>The first court entered by the visitor is the Green Court, in which are the
famous figures of the “Gladiator,” and of “Venus rising from the Bath.”
Around this court are Lord John’s Apartments, the Greenhouse, the
Bishop’s Stables, and various offices. The next court is known as the
Stone Court, from which Knole House itself is entered. From the
Great Hall a fine old staircase leads to the Brown Gallery.</p>

<p>The Brown Gallery is oak-panelled, and contains a large number of
portraits&mdash;copies, principally, in one style, apparently by one hand, and in
similar frames: they are chiefly of the worthies of the age of Elizabeth and
James, and form a series of much interest. In this gallery, also, are many
of those “easy-chairs” of the same epoch, for which the house at Knole has
long been famous, and which have been so valuable to artists. It is a long
and narrow apartment, panelled, roofed, and floored with oak. Here the
antique fastenings to the doors and windows are preserved in their early
purity; the stained windows are fresh, as if painted yesterday; while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1067" id="Page_1067">[1067]</a></span>
historic portraits give vitality to the striking and interesting scene, and seem
to remove two centuries from between the present and the past.</p>

<p>From the Brown Gallery a passage leads to the Chapel, fitted up with
tapestry, with stained-glass windows, and the other accessories of a place of
worship. The Chapel is of stately proportions, and flooded with a golden
light, admitted through the eastern window, which is full of old yellow
stained glass. It is kept in perfect order for daily service; but the appearance
of English texts, written in that imitation of old English which has
lately become prevalent, seems to jar with the traditional Catholicity of the
spot. The private gallery is, in fact, a large room, in which the members
of the family can be present at the worship, unseen by the servants or any
other attendants. The gallery is hung with some very fine tapestry, of a
bold style of execution, and in excellent preservation. The subject is not
explained by the tradition of the spot. It appears to refer to the legend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1068" id="Page_1068">[1068]</a></span>
St. Veronica, as the marvellous <i>sudarium</i>, or handkerchief, bearing the
impression of the features of Christ, is displayed in one scene, to the
astonishment of a truculent personage in an enormous crown, who appears
repeatedly in various parts of the canvas, and no doubt represents “the
Emperor”&mdash;a title of singular elasticity in monkish stories. The Chapel is
directly connected with the home chambers of the family: these are hung
with rare pictures by the great old masters, filled with objects of <i>virtu</i>
gathered in various countries by several members of the race, and distributed
with judgment and taste.</p>

<p>On the other side of the Brown Gallery are Lady Betty Germaine’s Bed-room
and Dressing-room: here, also, are fire-dogs, cabinets, and easy-chairs,
that time has made picturesque. Lady Betty Germaine, from whom this
room is named, was a great patroness of literature and the Arts. She was
daughter of the Earl of Berkeley, and second wife to Sir John Germaine.
Dying without issue, she left, as did her husband, an immense property to her
nephew, Lord George Sackville, who assumed the name of Germaine. After
his disgrace for alleged military incompetency in the reign of George II.,
he was loaded with honours by George III., and by him created Viscount
Sackville and Baron Bolebrooke. Lady Betty, by her will, bequeathed to
Lady Vere £20,000; to Lord George Sackville £20,000, and Drayton House
and estate; and, after other legacies, left the residue of her property to be
equally divided between them. Here, too, is the Spangled Bed-room,
which owes its name to the character of its draperies. The Billiard-room is
then reached, and then the Leicester Gallery, the most interesting of the
whole range: it is full of portraits of the highest merit by great masters&mdash;that
of the poet-Earl of Surrey being among its chief attractions. Leading
from this gallery is the Venetian Bed-room with its Dressing-room; between
them hangs a portrait of the Venetian ambassador, who gave the gallery its
name&mdash;Nicolo Molino. The looking-glass in this apartment repays careful
attention. It is framed in ebony, banded with silver; and in this and
similar articles of furniture the examples afforded of a free, bold style of
silver-work, English in its character, and eminently adapted to show to
advantage the lustrous surface of the noble metal, are very striking. In
some of the vases and sconces, of which copies are now to be seen at South
Kensington, the same class of workmanship may be studied.</p>

<p>Lovers of heraldic antiquity will look with respectful affection at the
pedigree of the noble family, a ponderous roll of parchment, fixed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1069" id="Page_1069">[1069]</a></span>
frame, as on the roller of a blind, so that it can be drawn out for consultation.
The arms blazoned on the portion visible are those borne in 1586.
Close by is a second roll of equal length, but of narrower width, which
appears to contain drawings of tombs and monuments, and copies of painted
windows, illustrative of the pedigree.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Cartoon Gallery.</i></p>

<p>The Cartoon Gallery&mdash;so called as containing copies in oil by Mytens
of six of the cartoons of Raffaelle&mdash;is also full of historic portraits. In
this room are some remarkably fine fire-dogs. Two of these interesting
objects from the Cartoon Gallery are engraved on our initial letter on
page 56.</p>

<p>The King’s Room, the room in which it is said, though without any
direct evidence, that James I. slept when a guest at Knole, is lined with
tapestry detailing the story of Nebuchadnezzar; the hangings of the bed are
thickly “inlaid” with silver&mdash;it is tissue of the costliest kind; a mirror of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1070" id="Page_1070">[1070]</a></span>
silver, an Art specimen of the rarest order; the various articles of the toilet
in the same metal; two marvellous ebony cabinets; and other objects of great
worth, account for the expenditure said to have been incidental to the visit
of the sovereign: it is added that as they were there placed and arranged in
the first years of the seventeenth century they have remained ever since. It is
probable that the furniture of this room is what was prepared for the King
at the grand reception given to him at Oxford by the Duke, and afterwards
brought to Knole. Knole has not, however, been without its royal visitors,
as we have already stated: among them were Henry VII., Henry VIII., and
Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The Dining-room contains the portraits of men made famous by genius
rather than rank. Here are Shakspere, Beaumont, Fletcher, Chaucer,
Congreve, Gay, Rowe, Garth, Cowley, Swift, Otway, Pope, Milton, Addison,
Waller, Dryden, Hobbes, Newton, Locke (the six last named by Kneller),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1071" id="Page_1071">[1071]</a></span>
Goldsmith, Dr. Johnson, Garrick (marvellous paintings by Sir Joshua
Reynolds), Walter Scott, and other heroes of the pen, many of whom were
honoured visitors at Knole during their lives, and have been reverenced there
since they left earth.</p>

<p>The Staircase at the Grand Entrance is singular and interesting: parts of
it are old, but the decorative portions are of a modern, and not of a good
character.</p>

<p>The Retainers’ Gallery, a gallery that runs the whole length of the house,
is on the topmost floor. From its peculiarly picturesque character it has been
drawn or painted by nearly every artist whose pencil has found work at
Knole: we engrave one portion of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1072" id="Page_1072">[1072]</a></span></p>

<p>The collection of fire-dogs at Knole is singularly rich; they adorn every
room throughout the mansion, the greater number being of chased silver.
The chairs and seats of various kinds, to be seen in all parts of the house, are,
as we have intimated, so many models for the artist.</p>

<p>The Great Hall has its dais, its Minstrels’ Gallery, and even its oak
tables, where retainers feasted long ago. In a window of the Billiard-room
is a painting on glass of a knight in armour, representing the famous ancestor
of the Sackvilles; and in the Cartoon Gallery are, also on glass, the armorial
bearings of twenty-one of his descendants, ending with Richard, the third
Earl of Dorset. Of the several Galleries and the Drawing-rooms it is
sufficient to state that they are magnificent in reference to their contents, and
beautiful as regards the style of decoration accorded to each. There is,
indeed, no part of the building which may not afford exquisite and useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1073" id="Page_1073">[1073]</a></span>
models to the painter&mdash;a fact of which the noble owners are fully aware, for
to artists they have afforded repeated facilities for study. It will not be
difficult to recognise, in some of the best productions of modern art, copies of
the gems which give value and adornment to the noble House of Knole.</p>

<p>The beeches of Knole have long been famous: they are of magnificent
growth, gnarled by time into picturesque forms, sometimes singly, here and
there in groups, and occasionally in long and gracefully arched avenues: of
the latter is the Duchess’s Walk. The gardens, too, are laid out with much
taste. The park is, indeed, one of the grandest and most striking, if not the
most extensive, in the kingdom.</p>

<p>There is not a gallery, not a room, that does not teach to the present and
the future the lessons that are to be learned from the past. Every step has
its reminder of the great men who have flourished in times gone by, to leave
their impress on their “hereafter”&mdash;</p>

<p class="dc13">THIS princely seat of the Howards is distant about
twenty miles from the venerable city of York,
on the road from thence to Malton. The railway
station, four miles from the mansion, on
the borders of the Derwent, and not far from
one of the most interesting of monastic ruins,
the ancient abbey of Kirkham, is pretty and
picturesque, and the drive from thence to the
castle is by a road full of beauty&mdash;passing by
tranquil villages and umbrageous woods, and
commanding, here and there, glorious and
extensive views of fertile country, far away
from the active bustle of busy life. Castle
Howard, one of the most perfect of the
“dwellings” that succeeded the castles and
“strong houses” of our forefathers, with its
gardens, grounds, lawns, plantations, woods, and all the accessories of
refined taste, is a model of that repose which speaks of happiness&mdash;and
makes it; and it is pleasant to imagine there the good statesman, retiring
from the political warfare in which he had so large a share, to leave
earth, “after life’s fitful fever,” in the midst of the graces of the demesne,
and the honourable and lofty associations connected with a numerous list
of heroic ancestors.</p>

<p>The Earl of Carlisle, the owner of Castle Howard, is descended from a
long line of noble and distinguished men whose services to their sovereigns
and their country gained for them the highest honours and distinctions; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1075" id="Page_1075">[1075]</a></span>
the parts they took in the troublous times in which they lived brought no
less than three of their brightest ornaments to the block under charges of
high treason.</p>

<p>The House of Howard, although not of the oldest of English families, is
one that claims precedence of rank over all others; for its head, the Duke
of Norfolk, is Premier Duke and Earl, Hereditary Earl Marshal, and Chief
Butler of England, and has, therefore, extraordinary importance attached
to it.</p>

<p>This great historical House can only with certainty be traced to Sir
William Howard, Judge of Common Pleas in the year 1297, although
plausible, and indeed highly probable, connections have been made out to a
much earlier period. They inherit much of their Norfolk property from
their ancestors, the Bigods. In the fourteenth century, by the match of the
then head of the family, Sir Robert Howard, with the heiress of Thomas
de Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, the foundation of the splendour and consequence
of the Howards was laid. That lady was Margaret, eldest
daughter of the Duke of Norfolk by his wife Elizabeth, daughter and
co-heiress of Richard, Earl of Arundel. The said Thomas de Mowbray,
Duke of Norfolk, was son and heir to John, Lord Mowbray, by Elizabeth, his
wife, daughter and heiress to John, Lord Segrave, and Margaret, his wife,
daughter and heiress of Thomas de Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk and Earl
Marshal of England, the eldest son of King Edward I., by his second wife
Margaret, daughter to Philip the Hardy, King of France.</p>

<p>By this splendid alliance Sir Robert Howard had an only son and two
daughters. The son, Sir John Howard, was created Lord Howard, and
afterwards Duke of Norfolk, and had the highest offices bestowed on him&mdash;a
title and honours which have (excepting the periods of sequestration)
remained in the family ever since.</p>

<p>All the present English peers of the noble House of Howard descend
from a common ancestor in Thomas, the second Duke of Norfolk of the
name of Howard, who died in 1524. Thus the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl
of Suffolk, and the Earl of Carlisle are descended from his first wife, Mary,
daughter and heiress to Henry Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel; and the Earl of
Effingham from his second wife, Margaret, daughter and heiress of Thomas,
Lord Audley of Walden, and widow of Lord Henry Dudley, son of the
Duke of Northumberland. The Howards of Greystoke, in Cumberland, are
a younger branch of the present ducal House, as are the Howards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1076" id="Page_1076">[1076]</a></span>
Glossop, &amp;c. The Howards of Corby Castle descend from the Carlisle
branch, tracing from “Belted Will Howard.” The titles and dignities now
enjoyed by different members of the family of Howard are&mdash;Duke of
Norfolk, Earl Marshal, and Hereditary Marshal of England; Premier
Duke and Earl next to the royal blood; Earl of Norfolk, Earl of Surrey,
Earl of Arundel, Baron Fitzalan, Baron Clun, Baron Oswaldestre, and
Baron Maltravers; Earl of Suffolk, Earl of Berkshire, Viscount Andover,
and Baron Howard; Earl of Carlisle, Viscount Howard of Morpeth (generally
called Viscount Morpeth), and Baron Dacre of Gillesland; Earl of
Effingham, Viscount Howard of Effingham, and Baron Howard of Effingham;
Baron Howard of Glossop; Baron Lanerton of Naworth; Earl of
Wicklow, Viscount Wicklow, and Baron Clonmore.</p>

<p>The earldom of Carlisle was originally enjoyed by Ranulph de Meschines,
nephew of Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester. The earldom appears
next to have been given to Andrew de Harcla, who was son of Michael de
Harcla, Governor of Carlisle, who afterwards “being condemned for a
traytor, he was at first in form degraded, having his knightly spurs hew’d
off from his heels; and at last hang’d, drawn, and quartered, 3rd March,
1322.”</p>

<p>The title was next enjoyed by the Plantagenets, and thus again merged
into the Crown. In 1620, the title&mdash;with those of Viscount Doncaster and
Baron Hay&mdash;was conferred on Sir James Hay: he was succeeded by his
son James, who died without issue. The title thus again became extinct,
and so remained until it was conferred on the Howards.</p>

<p>Lord William Howard&mdash;third son of the Duke of Norfolk, already
spoken of&mdash;was the “Belted Will Howard” of history, one of the leading
heroes of Border minstrelsy&mdash;the hero of whom Sir Walter Scott writes&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Costly his garb&mdash;his Flemish ruff<br />
Fell o’er his doublet, shaped of buff,</p>
<p class="pp7">With satin slashed and lined;</p>
<p class="pp6">Tawny his boot, and gold his spur,<br />
His cloak was all of Poland fur,</p>
<p class="pp7">His hose with silver twined;</p>
<p class="pp6">His Bilboa blade, by Marchmen felt,<br />
Hung in a broad and studded belt;&mdash;<br />
Hence, in rude phrase, the Borderers still<br />
Called noble Howard ‘<span class="smcap">Belted Will</span>.’”</p>

<p class="pn1">He was, as we have stated, the third son of the fourth Duke of Norfolk, and
grandson of the famous Earl of Surrey:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Who has not heard of Surrey’s fame?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1077" id="Page_1077">[1077]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">His father lost his title, his estates, and his head on Tower Hill, and
bequeathed him to the care of his elder brother, as “having nothing to feed
the cormorants withal.” He was married, in 1577, to the Lady Elizabeth
Dacre, daughter of Thomas, and sister and co-heiress of George, Lord
Dacre of Gillesland, the ages of both together being short of eight-and-twenty&mdash;he
being fourteen years old, and she a few months younger.
During the whole of the reign of Elizabeth, however, he and his brother
Arundel, and several other members of his family, were greatly oppressed&mdash;subjected
repeatedly to charges of treason, and kept in a state of poverty,
“very grievous to bear.” On the accession of James I. their prospects
brightened; Lord William was received into special favour, and, in 1605,
was appointed to the perilous post of King’s Lieutenant and Lord Warden
of the Marches, when the northern shires of England were exposed to
perpetual inroads of Border caterans. The onerous and very difficult duties
imposed upon him he discharged with equal fearlessness and severity.
His boast was so to act that the rush-bush should guard the cow; so that,
to quote “quaint old Fuller,” “when in their greatest height, the moss-troopers
had two fierce enemies&mdash;the laws of the land, and Lord William
Howard, who sent many of them to Carlisle, that place where the officer
does his work by daylight.”</p>

<p>Although formidable to his enemies, Lord William Howard was fervent
and faithful to his friends. His attachment to his lady was of the “truest
affection, esteem, and friendship;” and his love of letters and the refined
pursuits of leisure and ease rendered him conspicuous even among the
many intellectual men of the period. He was the friend of Camden and
other men of note. For Camden he copied the inscriptions on the Roman
remains in his district; and he collected together a fine library of the best
authors (part of which still exists), and, in addition, he himself edited the
“Chronicle of Florence of Worcester.” He collected a number of valuable
MSS., which now form a part of the Arundel Collection in the British Museum.
An excellent portrait of this great man, of whom the Howards may well
feel proud, is preserved at Castle Howard. His dress is a close jacket of
thick black figured silk, with rounded skirts to mid-thigh, and many small
buttons. The rest of his dress is also of black silk. His sleeves are turned
up, and he has a deep white falling collar. He wears a dress rapier, and is
bareheaded. The dress in which he is painted is, curiously enough,
ascertained, from the steward’s accounts of the time, to have cost £17 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1078" id="Page_1078">[1078]</a></span>
There is also a portrait by the same artist (Cornelius Jansen) of the Lady
Elizabeth, his wife. To the courage of the soldier “Belted Will” added
the courtesy of the scholar, and, although the “tamer of the wild border”
has been pictured as a ferocious man-slayer, history does him but justice in
describing him as a model of chivalry, when chivalry was the leading
characteristic of the age. He died in 1640, surviving the Lady Bessy&mdash;“Bessie
with the braid apron”&mdash;only one year, their union having continued
during sixty-three years, and leaving by her ten sons and five daughters,
the eldest of the sons being the direct ancestor of the Earls of Carlisle.
Their sons and daughters, with their wives and husbands and children, are
said, all at one time, to have lived with them; the family numbering fifty-two
persons. The sobriquet of “Belted Will” was “not, it is understood,
derived from the breadth of the baldric, a broad belt, the distinguishing
badge of high station, but rather meant ‘bauld,’ or bold, Willie; and that
the term ‘Bessie with the braid apron’ did not refer to that portion of a
lady’s dress, but to the <i>breadth</i>, or extent, of her possessions.”</p>

<p>Their eldest son, Sir Philip Howard, died in his father’s lifetime,
leaving by his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir John Carryl, a son, Sir
William Howard, who succeeded his grandfather, Lord William, in the
enjoyment of his estates. He married Mary, eldest daughter of William,
Lord Eure, by whom he had issue five sons&mdash;William (who died in the
lifetime of his father), Charles, Philip, Thomas, and John&mdash;and five
daughters. He was succeeded by his second son, Charles, who, for many
loyal services to his king, was, in 1661, created Baron Dacre of Gillesland,
Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Earl of Carlisle. He also enjoyed many
high appointments and privileges. He married Anne, daughter of Edward,
Lord Howard of Escrick, and had issue by her two sons, Edward and
Frederick Christian, and three daughters. Dying in 1684, his lordship was
succeeded by his eldest son, Edward Howard.</p>

<p>Edward, second Earl of Carlisle, married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
William Berkeley, by whom he had issue three sons and two daughters.
His lordship died in 1692, and was succeeded by his only surviving son,
Charles, as third earl, who, during the minority of his kinsman, the Duke of
Norfolk, held the office of Deputy Earl Marshal: many important posts were
conferred upon, and trusts reposed in, him. He married Lady Elizabeth
Capel, daughter of the Earl of Essex, by whom he left issue two sons&mdash;Henry,
who succeeded him, and Charles, a general of the army&mdash;and three daughters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1079" id="Page_1079">[1079]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry, who succeeded his father, in 1738, as fourth Earl of Carlisle,
married, first, Lady Frances Spencer, only daughter of Charles, Earl of
Sunderland, by whom he had issue three sons, who predeceased him, and
two daughters; and, secondly, in 1743, Isabella, daughter of William,
fourth Lord Byron, by whom he left issue one son&mdash;Frederick, who
succeeded him&mdash;and four daughters.</p>

<p>Frederick, fifth Earl of Carlisle, succeeded his father in the title and
estates in 1758, being at the time only ten years of age. In 1768 he was
made a Knight of the Thistle, and in 1793 installed as K.G. His lordship,
who was a man of letters and of high intellectual attainments, in 1801
published “The Tragedies and Poems of Frederick, Earl of Carlisle, K.G.”
This lord was the guardian of Lord Byron, and to him the “Hours of Idleness”
was dedicated. Some severe and satiric passages concerning the Earl
may be called to mind in “English Bards and Scotch Reviewers”&mdash;passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1080" id="Page_1080">[1080]</a></span>
which the erratic poet afterwards regretted.</p>

<p>George William Frederick, Viscount Morpeth, as seventh earl, one of
the most distinguished men of the age in literature and science, as well
as in the senate. His lordship, as Lord Morpeth, took a prominent part
in the political affairs of the kingdom, and among the important offices
he held, at one time or other in his useful life, were those of Lord-Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1082" id="Page_1082">[1082]</a></span>
of Ireland, Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, and
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was a man of the most refined
taste and of the highest intellectual culture, and his writings were of a
rare order of merit. He died unmarried in 1864, and was succeeded by his
brother&mdash;</p>

<p>The present noble peer, the Hon. and Rev. William George Howard,
eighth Earl of Carlisle, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, and Baron Dacre of
Gillesland, in the titles and estates. His lordship was born in 1808, and
was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he took honours,
and proceeded M.A. in 1840. In 1832 he was appointed to the rectory of
Londesborough, which living he held until 1866. He is senior co-heir to
the barony of Clifford, and is unmarried, the heir-presumptive to the
earldom being his brother, Admiral the Hon. Edward Granville George
Howard, R.N., Lord Lanerton. His lordship is patron of five livings&mdash;viz.
Brampton, Farlam, and Lanercost Abbey, in Cumberland; Slingsby,
in Yorkshire; and Morpeth, in Northumberland.</p>

<p>The arms of the Earl of Carlisle are&mdash;quarterly of six: 1st, <i>gules</i>, a

willing, but not able”).</p>

<p>His seats are Castle Howard, Yorkshire, and Naworth Castle, Cumberland.</p>

<p>The heir-presumptive to the titles and estates is, as just stated, Admiral
the Right Hon. Edward Granville George Howard, Baron Lanerton of
Naworth, which peerage was bestowed on him in 1873. He was born in
1809, entered the Royal Navy in 1823, and advanced step by step till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1083" id="Page_1083">[1083]</a></span>
became Admiral in 1870. He married, in 1842, Diana, daughter of the
Hon. George Ponsonby, by whom, however, he has no issue.</p>

<p>In the grounds of Castle Howard an avenue of about a mile in length,
bordered on either side by groups of ash-trees, leads to a pretty, cosy, and
comfortable inn, on the front of which is the inscription:&mdash;“CAROLUS
HOWARD, COMES CARLIOLENSIS, HOC CONDIDIT ANNO DOMINI
MDCCXIX.” It forms a sort of entrance gate to the park: the mansion,
however, is a long way off, the whole length of the avenue from the road
to the house being four miles, with the avenue of trees continued all the
way. Midway is an obelisk one hundred feet in height, which contains the
following inscriptions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Virtute et Fortunæ, Johannes, Marlburiæ<br />
Ducis Patriæ Europæquæ Defensoris.<br />
Hoc saxum admirationi ac famæ<br />
Sacrum Carolus Comes Carliol posuit,</p>
<p class="pp10">Anno Domini <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCXIV</span>.”</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“If to perfection these plantations rise,<br />
If they agreeably my heirs surprise,<br />
This faithful pillar will their age declare,<br />
As long as time these characters shall spare;</p>
<p class="pp6">Here then with kind remembrance read his name,<br />
Who for posterity perform’d the same.”</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Charles, the third Earl of Carlisle of the family of Howards, erected a Castle where the
old Castle of Henderskelf<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> stood, and called it Castle Howard. He likewise made the
plantations in this park, and all the outworks, monuments, and other plantations belonging
to the said seat.</p>

<p class="pbq">“He began these works in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCII</span>, and set up this inscription anno Domin
<span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCXXXI</span>.”</p>

<p class="p1">The history of the house is thus told; but it has no pretensions to the
name of a castle: the mansion is free from all semblance of character as a
place for defence, being simply and purely the domestic home of an English
nobleman, though, as our engravings show, very beautiful in construction,
of great extent, and perfect in all its appliances.</p>

<p>It is the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of the architect, Sir John Vanbrugh, he who laid in
England “many a heavy load,” and whose graceful and emphatically “comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1084" id="Page_1084">[1084]</a></span>”
structures, including notably that of Blenheim, adorn several of
our English shires. Comparing Castle Howard with Blenheim, Dr. Waagen
writes&mdash;“The former is less ‘broken up’ than the latter, and though not of
equal extent, has a grander and more massive appearance. In the whole
arrangement of the mansion and the garden, the architect evidently had
Versailles in his mind as the perfection of this style.”</p>

<p>Sir John Vanbrugh was, as his name indicates, of Dutch descent. He
was born at Chester in 1666. his father being a sugar-baker in that city. In
1695, his architectural skill having acquired him some reputation, he was
appointed one of the commissioners for completing Greenwich Palace, at the
time when it was about to be converted into a hospital. In 1702 he built
Castle Howard for the Earl of Carlisle, who was so pleased with his skill,
that, being at the time Deputy Earl Marshal of England, he conferred upon
him the important appointment of Clarencieux King-of-arms. In 1726 he
died, and was buried in the church of St. Stephen, Walbrook.</p>

<p>The South Front shows Castle Howard in its finest point of view: it is
in length 323 feet; the centre consists of a pediment and entablature
supported by fluted Corinthian pilasters; and the door is reached by a
flight of stately steps. “The North Front consists of an elaborate centre of
the Corinthian order, with a cupola rising from the top, and on either side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1086" id="Page_1086">[1086]</a></span>
extensive wings&mdash;the east according to the original design, the west from a
design by Sir James Robinson, which has been more recently built in a very
different style from the other wing; and, as the building has been deemed
by some architectural critics to be wanting in the qualities of lightness and
elegance, and uniformity of parts, to this circumstance is owing the alleged
incongruity.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Great Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From this point is the main or state entrance into the Great Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1087" id="Page_1087">[1087]</a></span>
pictured in the engraving. It is 65 feet high; a square of 35 feet; lit from
a dome, the top of which is 100 feet from the floor. The principal entrance
is on its north side, and the spaces between the piers on that and on the
south side are open the whole height of the arches. The south side opens
to the suite of apartments on the garden front, and a richly balustraded
gallery gives access to the upper rooms. The east and west sides are partly
filled, the upper portions being open, and showing the splendid ceilings of
the staircase, &amp;c. On one of these sides is the fire-place, and on the other
a canopied recess. The fire-place is a rich piece of sculptured marbles, and
there are panels filled with pendent groups of musical instruments; allegories
grace the ceilings and walls, principally painted by Pellegrini; and statues
and busts are placed on pedestals, and otherwise adorn the sides. These
allegorical paintings are, on the ceiling, the Fall of Phaëton; and on the walls,
the four seasons, the signs of the zodiac, the four quarters of the world,
Apollo and Midas, Apollo and the Muses, Mercury and Venus, Vulcan and
his attributes, &amp;c. Among the sculptures are Augustus, Marcus Aurelius,
Sabina, Julia Mammea, Bacchus, Ceres, Diodumenus, Paris, Hadrian,
Lucius Verus, Vitellius, Epaphroditus, Marc Antony, a bacchanal, and
others.</p>

<p>Several doors lead to the various apartments, the state-rooms being
hung with pictures of inestimable worth, and all being decorated in pure
taste. To the pictures we shall presently refer.</p>

<p>A gallery called the Antique Gallery&mdash;160 feet long, by 20 in width&mdash;contains
a number of rare, beautiful, and valuable examples of Roman, Egyptian,
and Greek antiquities, among which are many really fine and unique
specimens of early Art. It also contains many interesting pictures and some
good old tapestry. In the Museum has been collected an immense
variety of objects, gathered by several lords in various countries, with not a
few precious relics found in the ancient localities of Yorkshire and Cumberland:
among these are some examples of ancient mosaic-work, a curious
basso-relievo of Mercury, a number of urns and inlaid marbles, and other
objects. There is also here shown a casket or wine-cooler of bog-oak,
mounted in solid silver, a gift to the good Lord Carlisle by his constituents
of the West Riding; it measures 3 feet 6 inches in length, by 2 feet
4 inches in height and breadth, and cost about a thousand guineas; and
“a monster address, 400 feet long,” presented to him on his retiring from
the office of Chief Secretary for Ireland. One object of more than passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1088" id="Page_1088">[1088]</a></span>
interest is an altar supposed to have “stood in the temple of Apollo at
Delphi.” On its top is a tablet bearing the following lines from the pen,
we believe, of the Earl of Carlisle:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Pass not this ancient altar with disdain,</p>
<p class="pp7">’Twas once in Delphi’s sacred temple rear’d;</p>
<p class="pp6">From this the Pythian pour’d her mystic strain,</p>
<p class="pp7">While Greece its fate in anxious silence heard.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">What chief, what hero of the Achaian race,</p>
<p class="pp7">Might not to this have bow’d with holy awe,</p>
<p class="pp6">Have clung in pious reverence round its base,</p>
<p class="pp7">And from the voice inspired received the law?</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">A British chief, as famed in arms as those,</p>
<p class="pp7">Has borne this relic o’er th’ Italian waves,</p>
<p class="pp6">In war still friend to science, this bestows,</p>
<p class="pp7">And Nelson gives it to the land he saves.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Saloon has an exquisitely painted allegorical ceiling representing
Aurora, and is also adorned by a large number of statues and busts, as well
as valuable paintings.</p>

<p>The Drawing-room is hung with rich tapestry after Rubens’ designs,
and the walls are adorned with many gems of Art. Among the other
treasures in this elegant apartment are some fine antique bronzes.</p>

<p>The Gold or State Bed-room is hung with the finest Brussels tapestry,
after designs by Teniers. The chimney-piece is very elegant, being supported
by Corinthian columns, the shafts of Sienna marble, the capitals,
bases, and cornice white, with pigeons of polished white marble in the
centre of the frieze. Upon it stands a bust of Jupiter Serapis.</p>

<p>The Breakfast and Dining Rooms&mdash;and, indeed, the whole of the apartments
in the mansion&mdash;are elegantly and even sumptuously furnished, and
filled to repletion with objects of interest and of <i>virtu</i>.</p>

<p>The Crimson-figured Room has its walls painted, by Pellegrini, with
a series of incidents of the Trojan war: these are&mdash;the Rape of Helen,
Achilles in disguise amidst the daughters of Lycomedes, King of Scyros,
and Ulysses in search of him, Ajax and Ulysses contending for the armour
of Achilles, Troy in flames, and Æneas bearing on his shoulders Anchises
from the burning city.</p>

<p>The Blue Drawing-room, the Green Damask Room, the Yellow Bed-chamber,
the Silver Bed-room, the Blue Silk Bed-room, and, indeed, all
the remaining apartments, need no further remark than that they are, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1089" id="Page_1089">[1089]</a></span>
their furnishing and appointments, all that the most fastidious taste could
desire them to be.</p>

<p>The pictures that so lavishly adorn Castle Howard have been long
renowned. The collection contains some of the very finest examples of
the great old masters to be found in Europe. The best of them once
formed part of the famous Orleans Gallery, and were acquired by the
Earl of Carlisle when the French Revolution of 1789 caused their
distribution.</p>

<p>To name all the works in this collection would occupy more space than
we can spare: chief among them all is “The Three Marys,” by Annibale
Carracci; it suffices to name it as one of the world’s wonders in Art. And
also “The Adoration of the Wise Men,” by Mabuse, the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of the
master. Other grand examples are by Titian, Correggio, Domenichino,
Guercino, Carlo Maratti, Giorgione, Primaticcio, Julio Romano, Tintoretto,
Paolo Veronese, Velasquez, Cuyp, Claude, Ruysdael, Vandyke, Rubens,
Wouvermans, Breughel, Berghem, Jansen, Holbein, Huysman, Mabuse,
Van der Velde, Teniers, and Canaletti. Of Canaletti there are no fewer than
forty-five examples&mdash;his best productions in his best time&mdash;scattered
throughout the corridors and rooms, with famous specimens of Reynolds
and Lawrence, and family portraits by other artists; notably those of
Jackson, an artist who, from his obscure boyhood in Yorkshire, was
encouraged and upheld by the House of Carlisle.</p>

<p>The history of the dispersion of the Orleans Gallery deserves record here.
When the French prince, Philippe of Orleans, surnamed <i>Égalité</i>, wanted a
sum of money to carry out his political projects, he sold his entire gallery of
pictures (in 1792) for a comparatively insignificant amount: those of the
Italian and French schools to a banker of Brussels, and those of the
Flemish, Dutch, and German schools to an Englishman, Mr. T. M. Slade.
The Italian and French pictures subsequently passed into the hands of a
French gentleman, M. Laborde de Mèreville, who, being compelled to quit
his country during the Revolution, caused his pictures to be brought to
London, and ultimately sold them to Mr. Jeremiah Harman, a wealthy merchant.
“Thus matters stood,” says Dr. Waagen, in his “Treasures of Art
in Great Britain,” “till the year 1798, when Mr. Bryan”&mdash;the well-known
picture-buyer, and author of the “Dictionary of Painters and Engravers,” a
standard book of reference&mdash;“prevailed on the late Duke of Bridgewater,
Earl Gower, afterwards Marquis of Stafford, and the Earl of Carlisle, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1090" id="Page_1090">[1090]</a></span>
purchase this splendid collection for the sum of £43,000, and thus to secure
it for ever to England.”</p>

<p>The Conservatories are remarkably fine, and well ordered with all the
floral treasures of the world, while the collection of hardy herbaceous plants
congregated at Castle Howard, numbering upwards of six hundred species,
is unmatched elsewhere.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Garden.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Of the Gardens we give two engravings: the one chiefly to show a
charming fountain, a work of great merit, the production of the sculptor
Thomas; the other to convey an idea of the peculiar and very beautiful
character of the grounds and their adornments&mdash;the terrace walks, the lake,
the summer-house (Temple of Diana), and the Mausoleum, environed by
umbrageous woods; here and there vases judiciously interspersed with
memorial pillars, commemorating some striking event or some renowned
benefactor of the race of the Howards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1091" id="Page_1091">[1091]</a></span></p>

<p>The lawns and gardens are admirably laid out, somewhat trim and
formal, but not out of character with the building of which they are
adornments. The grounds are unsurpassed in beauty&mdash;that of which
Nature has been lavish, and that which is derived from Art.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>The Grand Fountain.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The ornamental grounds are of vast extent, and are beautifully diversified
with the varied attractions of lake, lawn, and forest. The parterre
“occupies several acres of a cheerful lawn, of which a considerable space
on the south front of the mansion is laid out in the most tasteful and
pleasing manner, and interspersed with flower-beds, clumps of evergreens
and shrubs, and statuary.” The Raywood, approached by a gravel walk
687 yards in length, with its delightful walks and grand old trees, also
abounds with statuary. Near the iron gates at which this walk commences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1092" id="Page_1092">[1092]</a></span>
is the Rosary, and close by is a pedestal erected by one earl, and inscribed
with some chastely beautiful lines by his successor. The Green Terrace
Walk, 576 yards in length, is adorned with statuary, and Lady Mary
Howard’s Garden is one of the most lovely features on the south front.</p>

<p>The Temple of Diana, from which charming views of the mansion and
its surroundings are obtained, is an Ionic erection, and bears in niches over
its doors busts of Vespasian, Faustina, Trajan, and Sabina.</p>

<p>The Mausoleum, a circular domed structure, 35 feet in diameter in its
interior, and 98 feet in height, contains in its basement sixty-four catacombs
built under ground arches. Externally, it is surrounded by a colonnade of
twenty-one Doric columns. In the vaults are interred many illustrious
members of this truly noble family: among these are the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth Earls of Carlisle; Frances and Caroline, Countesses of
Carlisle; and some of the sons and daughters of these “peerless peers
and peeresses.” The Mausoleum is interesting as being the first, unconnected
with a church, erected in England.</p>

<p>The Pyramid, on St. Ann’s Hill, 28 feet square at its base, and 50 feet
in height, was raised in 1728 to the memory of William, Lord Howard,
third son of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, who died in 1639. It contains in its
interior a bust, with the inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Gulielmus Dominus Howard, obiit x die Martis, ætatis suæ octogesimo primo, anno
salutis <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCXXXIX</span>;”</p>

<p class="pn1">and on its north side, on the exterior, the following inscription in marble:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“William, Lord Howard, third son to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, who was beheaded by
Queen Elizabeth, married Elizabeth, one of the co-heiresses of William, Lord Dacre; by
which marriage, and the said William’s great industry and ability, are descended to me
most of the estates that I now possess; in grateful remembrance therefore of that noble and
beneficent parent, and of that pious and virtuous lady, this monument is erected by Charles,
the third Earl of Carlisle of the family of the Howards, their great-great-great-grandson,
Anno Domini, 1728.</p>

<p class="dc14">KEDLESTON, the seat of Lord Scarsdale, is justly
considered to be one of the most pure and
chaste in design of any of the classical mansions
of our English aristocracy. It may,
therefore, both on that account and from the
beauty of its situation, the interest attaching
to the family of its noble owner, and the many
associations which surround it, well be called
a “Stately Home,” and thus claim to be
included in our present volume. At the time
of its erection, in 1761, it was pronounced to
be one of the most perfect specimens of architectural
taste in the kingdom, and it has,
consequently, been visited by many persons
of note: these have, one and all been lavish
in their praises of its proportions and parts,
of the interior details and finishing, of the
pictures and articles of <i>virtu</i> which it contains,
and of its grand old park, studded with the
finest of oaks and other forest trees.</p>

<p>Bray, who wrote in 1777, says of the present building&mdash;then, it must
be remembered, only newly erected&mdash;“Kedleston may properly be called
the glory of Derbyshire, eclipsing Chatsworth, the ancient boast of the
county; the front is magnificent and beautiful, the apartments elegant,
at the same time useful, a circumstance not always to be met with in a
great house.” This, of course, was before the great additions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1094" id="Page_1094">[1094]</a></span>
alterations were made to and at Chatsworth, and therefore must not be
taken to refer to that palatial residence as it now stands. Since Bray’s
time, every writer who has spoken of Kedleston speaks in the same strain of
praise of its symmetry and design.</p>

<p>Before describing the hall, or speaking of its history, we will, as usual,
give a brief genealogical account of the family of its noble owner. The
Curzons are said to be descended from Geraline de Curson, or Curzon, who
came over with the Conqueror, and was of Breton origin. This Geraline de
Curzon was lord of the manor of Locking, in Berkshire, and held, by the
grant of the King, many other manors and lands in that county and in
Oxfordshire. He was a great benefactor to the abbey of Abingdon. He
had three sons, Stephen, Richard, and Geraline, by the first of whom he
was succeeded. This Stephen de Curzon, besides the estates in Oxon and
Berks to which he had succeeded, had the manor of Fauld, in Staffordshire,
granted to him by William de Ferrars, Earl of Derby. He had an only
daughter, married to Nicholas Burton, of Fauld, and was succeeded by his
brother, Richard de Curzon, who, in the reign of Henry I., held four
knight’s fees in Kedleston, Croxhall, Twyford, and Edinghall, in the
county of Derby. He was succeeded by his son Robert, who married Alice
de Somervile, and was, in turn, succeeded by his eldest son, Richard, who
married Petronel, daughter of Richard de Camville, Lord of Creek, or
Creeth, by whom he had a son, Robert de Curzon, of Croxhall, “whose line
terminated in an heir female, Mary, daughter and sole heiress of Sir
George Curzon, who was married to Edward Sackville, Duke of Dorset. Of
this family was Cardinal de Curzon, so famous about the time of King
John.” Thomas Curzon, grandson of Robert, was succeeded by another
Thomas, whose son, Engelard Curzon (<i>temp.</i> Henry III.), left issue a son,
Richard, who (25 Edward I.) held a fourth part of a knight’s fee at
Kedleston. His son, Ralph, was father of Richard de Curzon, who
(4 Edward III.) held three parts of a knight’s fee at Kedleston, and was
succeeded by his son, Sir Roger de Curzon, of Kedleston, Knt., who was
living <i>temp.</i> Richard I. His son, Sir John Curzon, who was one of the
King’s Council, married Eleanor, daughter of Sir Robert Twyford, and was
succeeded by his son John, who married Margaret, daughter of Sir
Nicholas de Montgomery, by whom he had issue three sons&mdash;viz. Richard,
who succeeded him; Walter, who married Isabel, daughter of Robert
Saunders, Esq., of Harrington, in the county of Northampton, from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1095" id="Page_1095">[1095]</a></span>
marriage descended the Curzons of Water-Perry; and Henry, who was the
great-grandfather of Sir Robert Curzon, created a baron of the German
empire by Maximilian in 1500, and a baron of England by Henry VIII.,
but died without issue. The line of Curzon of Water-Perry, just now
alluded to, passed successively from Walter Curzon through his son and
grandson, Richard and Vincent, to Sir Francis Curzon, Knt., who married
Anne, daughter of Judge Southcote; his son, Sir John Curzon, who married
Mary, daughter of Robert, Lord Dormer; Sir Thomas Curzon, Bart. (son
of the last), who married Elizabeth Burrow, and was created a baronet in
1661; his son, Sir John Curzon, Bart., who was succeeded by his son, Sir
Francis Curzon, Bart., who died without surviving issue. The baronetcy thus
became extinct, the family estates of Water-Perry devolving eventually
upon Francis, Lord Teynham, who, in consequence, assumed the surname of
Curzon in addition to that of Roper.</p>

<p>Richard Curzon, the eldest son and successor of John Curzon and his
wife, Margaret Montgomery (just named), was, in the 11th year of
Henry VI., Captain of Sandgate Castle, Kent, and was succeeded by his
son, John Curzon, of Kedleston. This gentleman, generally known as
“John with the white head,” was high sheriff of the counties of Nottingham
and Derby in the 15th year of Henry VI., and, four years later, escheator
for the same. He married Joan, daughter of Sir John Bagot, by whom he
had issue one son, Richard, and four daughters, one of whom married John
Ireton, of Ireton, in Derbyshire, and was great-great-grandmother of
General Henry Ireton, the celebrated Parliamentarian officer.</p>

<p>Richard Curzon married Alice Willoughby, of Wollaton, of the family of
Lord Middleton, and, dying in 1496, left issue by her, two sons&mdash;John and
Henry&mdash;and a daughter, Elizabeth, who was prioress of King’s Mead,
Derby. This John de Curzon was high sheriff on three different occasions,
and died in the 4th year of Henry VIII. He married Elizabeth, daughter
of Stephen Eyre, of Hassop, and was succeeded by his only son and heir,
Richard, who married Helen, daughter of German Pole, of Radbourne, by
whom he had issue four sons and three daughters. The eldest son, John,
dying without issue, was succeeded by his brother Francis (aged twenty-five,
2 Edward VI.), who married Eleanor, co-heiress of Thomas Vernon, of
Stokesley, through whom a claim to the barony of Powis was brought into
the family. By this lady he had issue four sons (from one of whom the
Curzons of Minley were descended) and two daughters. He was succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1096" id="Page_1096">[1096]</a></span>
by his eldest son, John Curzon, who took to wife Millicent, daughter of Sir
Ralph Sacheverell, and widow of Sir Thomas Gell, of Hopton. He was
succeeded by his eldest son, Sir John Curzon, created a baronet by Charles I.
Sir John, who represented the county of Derby in Parliament, 15 and 16 of
Charles I., married Patience, daughter of Sir Thomas Crewe, and sister of
John, Lord Crewe, of Steene, by whom he had issue four sons&mdash;John,
Francis, and Thomas, who all died without issue, and Nathaniel, who
succeeded him&mdash;and three daughters&mdash;Patience, who died unmarried;
Eleanor, who married Sir John Archer, one of the judges of the Court of
Common Pleas; and Jane, who married John Stanhope, son of Sir John
Stanhope, of Elvaston, brother of Philip, Earl of Chesterfield.</p>

<p>Sir Nathaniel Curzon, Bart., succeeded his father in 1686. He married
Sarah, daughter of William Penn, of Penn, in the county of Bucks, by
whom he had issue five sons and four daughters, and died in 1718. His sons
were&mdash;Sir John, who succeeded him; Sir Nathaniel, who also succeeded to
the title and estates; Francis, who was a Turkey merchant, and died at
Aleppo unmarried; William, who represented Clitheroe in Parliament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1097" id="Page_1097">[1097]</a></span>
and Charles, LL.D. Sir John Curzon, Bart., who represented the county of
Derby in Parliament during the whole of the reign of Queen Anne, died
unmarried in 1727, when the baronetcy and estates passed to his brother,
Sir Nathaniel Curzon, who also represented, till his death in 1758, the
county of Derby in Parliament. He married Mary, daughter and co-heiress
of Sir Ralph Assheton, Bart., of Middleton, county Lancaster, by whom he
had issue three sons&mdash;-John, who died in infancy; Nathaniel, first Baron
Scarsdale; and Assheton, first Viscount Curzon, and father of the first Earl
Howe. This Assheton Curzon, created Baron and Viscount Curzon of
Penn, was member of Parliament for Clitheroe. He married, first, Esther,
daughter of William Hanmer, Esq., by whom he had issue the Hon. Penn
Assheton Curzon; secondly, Dorothy, sister of the first Earl of Grosvenor,
by whom, with other issue, he had a son, Robert, who married the Baroness
Zouche; and, thirdly, Anna Margaretta Meredith, by whom he had no issue.
The Hon. Penn Assheton Curzon, just alluded to, eldest son of Viscount
Curzon, married Charlotte Sophia, Baroness Howe, by whom he had issue
seven sons and three daughters, the eldest of whom was Richard William
Penn Curzon-Howe, created Earl Howe, who married twice&mdash;first, the Lady
Harriet Georgiana Brudenell, daughter of the Earl of Cardigan, by whom,
with others, he had issue the late Earl Howe; and, secondly, Ann Gore,
maid of honour to Queen Adelaide, by whom also he had issue. The Earl
died in 1870, and was succeeded by his eldest son, George Augustus
Frederick Louis Curzon-Howe, as second Earl Howe, Viscount Curzon,
Baron Curzon of Penn, and Baron Howe of Langar, who was born in 1821,
and was M.P. for South Leicestershire from 1857 to the time of his
accession to the peerage. His lordship married, in 1846, Harriet Mary,
daughter of the late Henry Charles Sturt, Esq., M.P., by whom, however,
he had no issue. He died in 1876, and was succeeded by his brother, the
Hon. Richard William Penn Curzon-Howe. The present peer, who is
third Earl Howe, Viscount Curzon, Baron Curzon of Penn, and Baron
Howe of Langar, was born in 1822, and, having entered the army, became
Captain in 1844, Major 1853, Lieut.-Colonel 1854, Colonel 1857, and Major-General
1868. Having served in the Kaffir war as Aide-de-camp to Sir
George Cathcart, and at the siege of Delhi, at which time he was Acting
Assistant Quartermaster-General, he became Military Secretary to the
Commander-in-chief in India, and was also an Aide-de-camp to H.R.H.
the Duke of Cambridge. His lordship married, in 1858, Isabella Katherine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1098" id="Page_1098">[1098]</a></span>
daughter of Major-General the Hon. George Anson, and has issue, besides
other children, a son, the Hon. George Richard Penn Curzon-Howe, who
is heir to the titles and estates.</p>

<p>Sir Nathaniel Curzon died in 1758, and was succeeded by his eldest son,
Nathaniel Curzon, who, in 1761, was raised to the peerage by the style and
title of Baron Scarsdale of Scarsdale, in the county of Derby&mdash;the title
being derived from the hundred of Scarsdale in that county. His lordship
had previously married the Lady Catherine Colyear, daughter of the Earl of
Portmore, by whom he had issue five sons and one daughter. He died in
1804, and was succeeded in his title and estates by his eldest son, the Hon.
Nathaniel Curzon, as second Lord Scarsdale. This nobleman married, first,
the Hon. Sophia Susannah Noel, sister and co-heiress of Thomas, Viscount
Wentworth, by whom (who died in 1782) he had issue the Hon. Nathaniel,
who succeeded him, and the Hon. Sophia Caroline, who married Robert
Viscount Tamworth, son of Earl Ferrars. Lord Scarsdale married, secondly,
a Roman Catholic lady, Félicité Anne de Wattines, of Tournay, in Belgium,
by whom (who died in 1850) he had, with other issue, the Hon. and Rev.
Alfred Curzon; the Hon. Francis James Curzon, barrister-at-law; the
Hon. Mary Elizabeth, married to John Beaumont, Esq., of Barrow; and the
Hon. Caroline Esther, married to William Drury Holden, Esq., of Locko
Park, in Derbyshire, who assumed the surname of Lowe instead of that of
Holden, and is well known as William Drury Lowe, Esq.</p>

<p>The Hon. Nathaniel Curzon succeeded his father as third Lord Scarsdale
in 1837, but died unmarried in 1856, when the title and estates passed to his
nephew, the present peer, the Rev. Alfred Nathaniel Holden Curzon, second
son of the Hon. and Rev. Alfred Curzon, already mentioned.</p>

<p>The Hon. and Rev. Alfred Curzon, eldest son, by his second marriage,
of the second Lord Scarsdale, was born in 1801, and married in 1825 Sophia,
daughter of Robert Holden, Esq., of Nuttall Temple, by whom he had
issue two sons&mdash;George Nathaniel Curzon, Esq., who was accidentally
killed by being thrown from his horse, and the Rev. Alfred Nathaniel
Holden Curzon, the present Lord Scarsdale&mdash;and two daughters, Sophia
Félicité Curzon and Mary Curzon, the elder being married to W. H.
De Rodes, Esq., of Barlborough Hall, and the younger to Lord Arthur
Edwin Hill-Trevor, son of the Marquis of Downshire. He died in
January, 1850.</p>

<p>The present peer, the Rev. Alfred Nathaniel Holden Curzon, succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1099" id="Page_1099">[1099]</a></span>
his uncle in the title and estates as fourth Baron Scarsdale, and
as a baronet, in 1856. His lordship, who was born in 1831, was educated
at Rugby, and at Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1852,
and M.A. in 1865. In 1856 he became Rector of Kedleston, and in the same
year married Blanche, second daughter of Joseph Pocklington Senhouse,
Esq., of Nether Hall, Cumberland, by whom he has issue living&mdash;the Hon.
George Nathaniel, heir-apparent, born 1859; the Hon. Alfred Nathaniel,
born 1860; the Hon. Francis Nathaniel, born 1865; the Hon. Assheton
Nathaniel, born 1867; the Hon. Sophia Caroline, born 1857; the Hon.
Blanche Felicia, born 1861; the Hon. Eveline Mary, born 1864; the Hon.
Elinor Florence, born 1869; the Hon. Geraldine Emily, born 1871; and
the Hon. Margaret Georgiana, born 1874. Lady Scarsdale died in 1875.
His lordship is patron of five livings (viz. Kedleston, Quarndon, Mickleover,
and Littleover, in Derbyshire, and Worthington, in Leicestershire), and is
a magistrate for the county of Derby.</p>

wings displayed and inverted, <i>or</i>, collared,

<p>The title of “Scarsdale” had previously been held by the family of
Leake, but had become extinct. The Leakes were descended from Adam
de Leca, of Leak, in Nottinghamshire, who was living in 1141. William
Leake, or Leke, who settled at Sutton-in-the-Dale, or, as it is frequently
called, Sutton-Scarsdale, in Derbyshire, early in the fifteenth century, was a
younger son of Sir John Leake, of Gotham. One of his descendants, Sir
Francis Leke, Knt., married one of the co-heiresses of Swift, of Rotherham,
and by her had issue a son, Francis Leke, who, on the institution of the
order of baronetcy, was created a baronet in 1611. In 1624 he was created
Baron Deincourt of Sutton, and, having taken an active part for the King
during the civil wars, was in 1645 raised to the dignity of Earl of Scarsdale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1100" id="Page_1100">[1100]</a></span>
He married Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Carey, Knt., and had issue by
her&mdash;Nicholas, his successor; Francis, Edward, and Charles, slain in battle;
and six daughters, one of whom was married to Viscount Gormanston, and
another to Charles, Lord Lucas. His lordship felt the execution of his
royal master, Charles I., so acutely, that he clothed himself in sackcloth,
and, causing his grave to be dug some years before his death, laid himself
in it every Friday for divine meditation and prayer. He died in 1665, and
was succeeded by his son Nicholas as second Earl of Scarsdale and Baron
Deincourt. This nobleman married Lady Frances Rich,
daughter of the Earl of Warwick, and died in 1680.
His eldest son, Robert, succeeded to the titles and
estates, and having married Mary, one of the co-heiresses
of Sir John Lewis, was made Lord-Lieutenant
of Derbyshire, Colonel of Horse, and Groom of the
Stole to Prince George of Denmark. Dying in 1707,
he was succeeded, as fourth Earl of Scarsdale and
Baron Deincourt, by his nephew, Sir Nicholas Leke,
who, dying unmarried in 1736, the titles, including
the baronetcy, became extinct.</p>

<p>The old hall of Kedleston, the ancient residence
of the Curzon family for many generations, stood nearly on the site
occupied by the present magnificent mansion. It was a fine quadrangular
brick building of three stories in height, the entrance being
under an advanced balustraded portico of three arches. Adjoining the
house were training paddocks and all the appliances for the stud which
was kept up. Of this house, fortunately, a painting is preserved in
the present mansion. Not so of the still older house, of which no representation
appears to be remaining. It must, however, judging from the
records of the armorial bearings which decorated its stained-glass windows
when the survey was made in 1667, have been a building possessed of
many noticeable features. In the north window of the hall of 1677 we find
recorded some of the bearings of the most distinguished families of the time,
which seem to throw a strong light on the connections of the Curzon family.
Among the arms, either alone or quartered or impaled, were, it seems, in the
north window of the hall, Curzon, Twyford, Arden, Bek or Beke, Gresley,
Wasteneys, Chandos of Radborne, Talbot, Furnival, and Montgomery of
Cubley; in the south windows those of Curzon and Bagot; in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1101" id="Page_1101">[1101]</a></span>
window those of Curzon, Vernon, Ludlow, Poole or Pole, and the device of
the House of Lancaster; at the upper end of the hall, Curzon and Pole with
Pole’s quarterings, Curzon alone, Curzon and Vernon with Vernon’s quarterings,
and Curzon and Sacheverell with Sacheverell’s quarterings. About the
room the following coats were irregularly dispersed&mdash;viz. Sacheverell, Vernon,
Pole, Bagot, Montgomery, Ireton, Minors, Curzon, Twyford, and Brailsford;
and on the inside of the large chimney of the Buttery were Touchet, Lord
Audley of Marston, Erm, a chevron and lion rampt, but the colours gone,
and Latimer or Greville (a cross fleury), and Frecheville. On the outside of
the same chimney, a saltier without colour; Montgomery as before; a
border of horse-shoes, probably Ferrers; Griffith of Whichnor, &amp;c. These
were presumed to be about the date of Henry IV., and the door was
supposed at that time to be at least three hundred years old.</p>

<p>The old hall and the venerable church are said to have stood about the
centre of the then village of Kedleston, and a corn-mill was near. The
whole of the village, every house and every vestige of habitation, the “small
inn for the accommodation of those who came to drink of a medicinal well,
which has the virtues of the Harrogate water,” the corn-mill, and the old
hall itself, were removed by the first Lord Scarsdale to make room for the
present mansion, which he erected in 1765: the church alone remained.
The village was removed to a charming spot a short distance off; the corn-mill
was taken away; the stream which turned its wheel was converted into
the magnificent lake that forms so fine a feature in the present park; the
turnpike-road was removed to a distance of more than half a mile; and the
“small inn” was replaced by the present capacious Kedleston Inn, some
three-quarters of a mile away from its original site.</p>

<p>The present edifice was built from the designs of Robert Adam, one of
the architect brothers of the Adelphi, and is considered to be his masterpiece.
It consists of a noble central pile with two advanced wings or
pavilions, with which it is connected by two curved corridors. The principal
or north front has a grand central portico, the entablature and pediment of
which are supported by six magnificent columns, 30 feet high, and 3 feet in
diameter: some of these are composed of one single stone their entire
length. They are designed from those at the Pantheon at Rome. The
entrance in the portico is approached by a double or reflected flight of
stone steps, which again are marvellous for the size of the stones: they are
10 feet in length, and each stone forms two steps. The pediment is surmounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1102" id="Page_1102">[1102]</a></span>
by figures of Venus, Bacchus, and Ceres, and the sculptured <i>bassi-relievi</i>
(by Collins) represent vintage, pasturage, harvest, ploughing, and
boar-hunting; while within the porticos are statues of a Bacchante, two of
the Muses, and a Vestal. The Arcade, leading to Cæsar’s Hall, and the
Corridors, are designed from the Amphitheatre. The Grand Entrance is in
the centre of the portico, and opens at once into the Great Hall.</p>

<p>The Great Hall, a noble room, and one of the finest classical apartments
in existence in the purity of its style, the beauty of its details, and the
perfection of its proportions, is about 67 feet in length by 42 feet in width,
and 40 feet in height. The vaulted ceiling rises to the full height of the
house, and is supported on twenty fluted Corinthian columns 25 feet in
height, and 2 feet 6 inches in diameter. These columns, which are “the
glory of Kedleston,” are of native alabaster from Red Hill, in Leicestershire.
The Hall is decorated with paintings and sculpture, the whole being
classical, and in perfect keeping with the design of the building itself. The
subjects of the <i>chiaro-oscuro</i> paintings on the east side are&mdash;“Helen reproaching
Paris, and silenced by Venus,” “Achilles receiving Armour from Thetis,”
“Achilles delivering his Armour to Patroclus,” and “Mercury, Juno, and
Neptune before Jupiter;” on the west side, “Helen and Paris,” “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1103" id="Page_1103">[1103]</a></span>
Judgment of Paris,” “Hector and Andromache,” and “Juno and
Minerva.” At the ends are “Apollo and the Hours,” “Night distributing
her Poppies,” and “Sacrifices to Sylvanus, Diana, Apollo, and Mars.”
Over the doors are four marriage subjects. The statues are Apollo
Belvedere, Meleager, Idol, Venus, Faun, Apollo Vil. Med., Urania, Faun,
Venus, Ganymede, Antinous, and Mercury. From the Hall the Dining-room
is entered on the right, the Music-room on the left, and the Saloon at the
south end.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Great Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Our account of the principal rooms must necessarily be very brief. It is
enough to say that they are all fitted and finished in the most exquisite taste
and in the most sumptuous manner, and are hung, or rather decorated&mdash;for
the greater part of the pictures are let into the walls, as a part of the original
design&mdash;with one of the best collections of paintings any house can boast.</p>

<p>The Music-room, a remarkably elegant apartment, contains many
notable pictures, especially an “Old Man’s Head” by Rembrandt, Giordano’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1104" id="Page_1104">[1104]</a></span>
“Triumph of Bacchus,” Guido’s “Bacchus and Ariadne,” Guercino’s
“David’s Triumph,” and Leonardo da Vinci’s “Holy Family.” The
chimney-piece contains a beautiful bas-relief by Spang. The Corridor and
Corridor Staircase also contain many choice pictures.</p>

<p>The Drawing-room is a gorgeous apartment, hung with blue damask.
It is 44 feet in length and 28 feet in width and height, and has a beautiful
coved ceiling. The door-cases are finished with Corinthian columns of
Derbyshire alabaster, and the chimney-piece of Italian marble is supported
by two exquisitely sculptured whole-length female figures. The furniture,
especially the couches, is of the most gorgeous character&mdash;the carved and
gilt figures and foliage being in the very highest and purest style of Art.
The paintings in this room include splendid examples by Annibale Carracci,
Paul Veronese, old Francks, Breughel, Teniers, Cuyp, Mompert, Andrea del
Sarto, Domenichino, Raffaelle, Swanevelt, Guido Reni, Benedetto Luti,
Polemberg, Bernardo Strozzi, Claude Lorraine, Tintoretto, Parmigiano,
and others of the old masters.</p>

<p>The Library&mdash;a noble room fitted with mahogany book-cases, a Doric
entablature, and mosaic ceiling&mdash;contains among its pictures Vandyke’s
“Shakspere,” Rembrandt’s “Daniel interpreting to Nebuchadnezzar,” and
examples of Giordano, Carlo Loti, Drost, Michael Angelo, Salvator Rosa,
Poussin, and others. It also contains busts of Homer, Sappho, Socrates,
Virgil, Anacreon, Pindar, and Horace.</p>

<p>The Saloon is a grand circular apartment, 42 feet in diameter, and
63 feet high to the rose in the dome. It is considered, and truly, to be one
of the most beautiful rooms of its kind in Europe. Its decorations are
interesting from the classic taste displayed in designing them, and the
elegance with which they are executed. It is divided into four recesses, or
alcoves, having fire-places representing altars, with sphinxes, &amp;c., adorned
with classical figures in bas-relief; these alternate with as many doors; the
whole painted and ornamented with white and gold. Over the doors are
paintings of ruins by Hamilton (the frames representing the supporters of
the family arms), and above the recesses are delineations in <i>chiaro-oscuro</i> by
Rebecca&mdash;the subjects from English history. The pillars, of scagliola
marble, are by Bartoli. The dome is white and gold, finished in octagonal
compartments with roses. The candle branches are of peculiar elegance,
and beneath them is a charming series of exquisite bas-reliefs of Cupids, &amp;c.
The Saloon opens on its respective sides into the Great Hall, the Library,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1105" id="Page_1105">[1105]</a></span>
the Ante-chamber, and the south or garden front of the hall. From the
ante-chamber, in which are Carlo Maratti’s “St. John” and many other
valuable paintings, is reached&mdash;</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Saloon.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Principal Dressing-room, hung with blue damask, which contains,
among others, life-size portraits of the first Lord and Lady Scarsdale by
Hone; the second Lord Scarsdale by Reinagle, and his first wife by Hone;
Charles I. by Vandyke; Prince Rupert’s daughter by Kneller; Prince
Henry by Jansen; Prior by Kneller; and other paintings by Lely, Vandyke,
Cimaroli, and others.</p>

<p>The State Bed-room is hung with blue damask, and contains a remarkably
fine assemblage of family portraits, landscapes, and other pictures,
among which are Sir Nathaniel and Lady Curzon by Richardson; Duchess
of York by Lely; and the Countess of Dorset, daughter of George Curzon,
after Mytens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1106" id="Page_1106">[1106]</a></span></p>

<p>The Wardrobe, which adjoins, is principally remarkable for a fine
collection of thirty-six ancient enamels after Albert Dürer, representing the
life of our Saviour, and for the many fine family portraits and other paintings
which it contains. Among these are&mdash;Lady Curzon and her sons, by
Dobbs; Countess of Dorchester, by Kneller; the wife and child of Quentin
Matsys, by himself; Hon. Caroline Curzon, by Angelica Kauffmann; Hon.
H. Curzon, by Hamilton; family portraits, by Hone and Barber; the
“Nativity” and the “Resurrection,” by Murillo; and the first Lady Scarsdale,
by Hudson.</p>

<p>The Dining-room is of faultless proportions, and its fittings&mdash;all precisely
as originally planned by the architect&mdash;are in the best and purest
taste. The ceiling is magnificently painted in compartments by Zucchi.
The centre represents “Love embracing Fortune;” the oblong squares,
the four Seasons; and the small circles, Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.
In front of the recessed sideboard is a magnificent cistern, or cooler, cut out
of a solid block of Sicilian jasper; and among the pictures are examples of
Snyders, Zuccarelli, Ciro Ferri, Claude Lorraine, Jean Fyt, Romanelli,
Helmbrecker, and others, and bas-reliefs by Collins and Spang.</p>

<p>On the Great Staircase are also many choice paintings (including, among
others, examples of Carlo Maratti, Hamilton, and old Stone, and some fine
statues and candelabra), while in the family wing of the house&mdash;in Lady
Scarsdale’s Boudoir, the Ante-room, the Breakfast-room, and the other
apartments&mdash;the assemblage of works of Art is very extensive and valuable.
In the Corridor, too, are some good paintings, and many articles of <i>virtu</i>;
while in the chimney-piece is an extremely fine plaque of Wedgwood’s
jasper-ware.</p>

<p>The opposite wing is occupied by the Kitchen&mdash;a noble apartment with a
gallery at one end, supported on Doric columns, and having over its fire-place
the admirable motto, “Waste not, want not”&mdash;and the other domestic
offices.</p>

<p>Cæsar’s Hall is the basement story beneath the portico, and is decorated
with busts of the Cæsars, and medallions of Homer, Hesiod, Horace, and
Tully; and in the Tetrastyle Hall, the staircases, and other parts of the
building, are numerous works of Art of one kind or other.</p>

<p>The Garden Front, shown in the opposite engraving, is an adaptation
of an idea taken from the design of the Arch of Constantine. The statues in
the niches are Flora Farnese and an antique Bacchus. Over the pillars are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1107" id="Page_1107">[1107]</a></span>
medallions of Apollo and Diana, and the statues above are the Pastoral and
the Comic Muses, Prudence, and Diana. By the steps are the Medicean
and Borghese vases.</p>

<p>The entrance to the noble park of Kedleston is by a lodge, designed by
Adams from the Arch of Octavia. From it the drive to the house is about
a mile in length, amidst the finest forest trees, beneath which hundreds of
deer browse in every direction. Nearing the house, the drive is carried
over the magnificent lake on a bridge of purely classical design, enriched
by statuary; and from it one of the finest views of the mansion and its
surroundings is obtained. Near to the drive is a charmingly picturesque
fountain, whose waters are constantly flowing through a lion’s mouth.</p>

<p>In the park are the medicinal springs known as “Kedleston Baths,”
over which a plain, but picturesque, building was erected many years ago.
The waters are the best of the sulphureous springs of Derbyshire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1108" id="Page_1108">[1108]</a></span>
approach closely, on analysis, to those of Harrogate. They were formerly
in much repute, and years ago it was quite a trade for the poor people of
Derby to fetch these waters to the town, where they were sold at a penny
per quart, and were drunk in place of malt liquor by many of the
inhabitants. Kedleston, in the latter part of last century, was, indeed, a
very favourite resort with the Derby people, as is evidenced by the following
curious advertisement of the year 1776:&mdash;“Kedleston Fly. Twice a day
during the Summer Season. Will set out on Monday next, the 20th
inst., from John Campion’s, the Bell Inn, in Sadler-gate, Derby; each
person to pay One Shilling and Sixpence. A good Ordinary is provided
each day at Kedleston Inn. If desired, the coach may be had from nine
in the morning till two in the afternoon.” At Quarn, or Quarndon,
about a mile distant, is another medicinal spring&mdash;this time of chalybeate
waters, which were, and yet are, with those of Kedleston, much
esteemed.</p>

<p>Of the fine old oaks in Kedleston Park it is enough to say they are
among the largest and most picturesque in the kingdom, the “King Oak”
being twenty-two feet in circumference at the bole, and the “Queen Oak”
nearly as much&mdash;a truly stately and royal pair. Many others are also
enormous in girth and stature. Of these oaks the Hon. Grantley Berkeley
thus graphically writes:&mdash;“In the park and vale of Berkeley, as well as in
the Forest of Dean, I have been used to view the oak-tree in perfection, as
well as in gigantic decay, as in the case at Berkeley of ‘King William’s
Oak,’ at the entrance to the park, set down as that tree was, and is now, in
Domesday Book as a tree then so much larger than its fellows as to be
selected in the survey as a mark for the parish or hundred of Berkeley.
With all this timber lore, however, the tall oaks of Kedleston Hall
astonished me, not in a few instances, but in hundreds, or indeed all over
the park. Timber of all kinds stood on those emerald undulations (for
never was a park or pasture greener), valued by their proprietor as much for
intrinsic worth as for picturesque beauty, honoured in age, as they had been
spared when from their ranks might have been hewn a fortune. So struck
was I with the invariable size of these trees, that while casting a curious
eye through the herds of deer to make myself acquainted with the best
buck in that early season, destined for a trial of Pape’s breech-loading
rifle&mdash;which had been returned to his hands to be rearranged after the
trick it played me in the forest of Lord Breadalbane some time ago&mdash;I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1109" id="Page_1109">[1109]</a></span>
not help stepping their circumference at the roots of some of them, the
extent of which was as follows. The oaks very commonly reached to
fourteen yards where they entered the ground, and ranged from that to
fifteen and seventeen yards; while the ‘King Oak,’ standing by his
‘Queen’ of nearly the same size, measured twenty-two yards where it
sought the earth. Three feet from the ground the girth of this monarch of
the forest is twenty-five feet nine inches, and the timber contained in the
tree is calculated at from eleven hundred to twelve hundred feet. The
extraordinary beauty of these oaks&mdash;and their name, so to speak, is legion&mdash;lies
in their immensely tall straight growth from the ground, scarcely
ever putting forth a limb within reach of my upstretched hand. The same
luxuriant fact in this enchanting park exists with all kinds of trees, and
some of the broad-leafed elms round whose boles I stepped measured fifteen
yards. Lord Scarsdale takes beautiful care of his trees, and when some
high wind tears down a huge arm from his favourites, the splinters are all
sawn smoothly off from the stem, and the wound is capped with lead to
prevent the entrance of water.”</p>

<p>And now for a word or two on the Church, which is one of the most
charming old buildings in the country. Long may it be kept from the
hands of the “restorer!” The edifice is cruciform, consisting of a nave,
chancel, north and south transepts, and central tower&mdash;the south transept
being the mortuary chapel of the Curzons. The south doorway of the nave
is early Norman, with beak-head mouldings and a sculptured tympanum;
and the “priest’s door” in the chancel is equally interesting, although of
later date.</p>

<p>In the chancel is a remarkably fine monument to Sir Nathaniel Curzon,
Bart., who died in 1758, aged eighty-four, designed by Robert Adam, the
architect of Kedleston, and executed by Michael Rysbrach in 1763; and
another monument erected in 1737 to Sir Nathaniel Curzon, and Dame Sarah,
his wife, daughter of William Penn, Esq. There are also a fine, but partially
mutilated, brass to an early Curzon, and an incised slab to William Curzon,
1544. The east window of stained glass, “In Memory of George Nathaniel
Curzon, born Oct. 1826; died June 17, 1855,” is of beautiful design. In
the floor of the chancel, on removing two massive circular pieces of wood
mounted with rings, about a foot below the surface, each within a deeply
cut quatrefoil, are the heads of a knight in armour and of a lady in veil and
whimple. There is no inscription connected with these extremely curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1110" id="Page_1110">[1110]</a></span>
and unusual monuments, but they most probably represent a knight and
lady of the Curzon family.</p>

<p>In the Curzon Chapel, south transept, are fine old monuments, some of
which are shown in the opposite engraving. One of these is a knight
and lady on an altar tomb, the knight in plate armour with collar of SS,
and the other the monument of a knight, also in collar of SS. Besides
these are monuments and tablets to Sir John Curzon and Patience Crewe,
his wife, 1604; Sir John Curzon, 1727; Nathaniel, second Lord Scarsdale,
1837, and his lady, 1850; and many others to different members of the
family, besides a fine canopy of a “founder’s tomb.”</p>

<p>The Church closely adjoins the hall, from which there is an entrance
into the churchyard. At the east end of the Church is a quaintly curious
sundial, bearing, above the dial itself, the words <i>We shall</i>, and thus
reading&mdash;</p>

<p class="dc13 p4">OF the earlier life of Sir Thomas Audley, the founder of Audley
End, or of the family from which he sprang, but little is
known. His rise was rapid, as his rapacity was great, and,
like others in the very extraordinary times in which he lived, he
fawned on his sovereign and preyed on the possessions of others
until he had raised himself to a high position. “Thomas Audley,”
says a writer in 1711, “being a sedulous student in the law, became
Autumne Reader to the Inner Temple, temp. Henry VIII., and was after
chosen Speaker of the House of Commons, in the 21st of Henry VIII.
In which station (this being the parliament that gave the finishing hand to
the dissolution of monasteries) he was so acceptable to the king that he at
first made him Attorney of the Duchy of Lancaster, next Serjeant-at-Law,
being after the King’s Own Serjeant; and upon the resignation of the Lord
Chancellor More, he was knighted, made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal,
and, before the end of the year, Lord Chancellor of England. And the 30th
of Henry VIII. sat as Steward upon the arraignment of Henry Courtney,
Marquis of Exeter, for endeavouring to advance Cardinal Pole to the crown.
And subtilly, at length, obtaining the great Abbey of Walden, in Essex, he
was, in the 30th of Henry VIII., created Lord Audley of Walden, and died
the 35th of Henry VIII., leaving issue by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of
Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dorset, only two daughters his heirs&mdash;Mary, who
died unmarried; and Margaret, who became his sole heir, first married to
the Lord Henry Dudley, and after to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, as second
wife, whose son by her, Thomas, Earl of Suffolk, Lord Treasurer of
England, built upon the ruines of the abby that stately fabrick at Walden,
call’d Audley-End, in memory of this Lord Audley.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1113" id="Page_1113">[1113]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas Audley, who, as has just been stated, was the principal agent in
the great work of spoliation, the dissolution of monasteries, was rewarded for
his zeal by grant after grant from the spoils, and yet was always, as is
shown by his letters, whining and craving for more. The rich priory of
Christchurch, Aldgate, London, “with all the church plate and lands
belonging to that house, was first granted to him; and afterwards many
portions of the estates previously belonging to the lesser religious houses of
Essex, with licenses to alienate them, of which he duly availed himself.
Thus St. Botolph’s Priory, at Colchester, with all its revenues, the Priory
of the Crutched Friars, in the same town, and Tiltey Abbey, near Thaxted,
were added to the list of his monastic spoils, after the gifts from the king, in
1538, on Sir Thomas’s application, of the rich Abbey of Walden, with all
the estates, manors, and advowsons thereunto attached. He was also created
Lord Audley of Walden, and installed a Knight of the Garter. Yet,” says
the late Lord Braybrooke, “instead of Audley being contented with these
repeated marks of the royal favour, we are compelled to admit that every
grant which he obtained encouraged him to importune the king for further
recompense; and his letters, preserved in the Cottonian Library, prove that,
in making these applications, he was mean enough to plead poverty as an
excuse, and even to assert that his character had suffered in consequence of
the public services which he had been obliged to perform.”</p>

<p>Lord Audley, at his death in 1544, left two daughters, his co-heiresses;
but the younger one dying in 1546, the eldest, Margaret Audley, became
sole heiress to the estates. This lady was married twice: first, at the age
of fourteen, to Lord Henry Dudley, younger brother to Lord Guildford
Dudley, husband of the unfortunate Lady Jane Grey, by whom she had no
issue; and secondly, in 1557, to Thomas Howard, fourth Duke of Norfolk,
as his second wife. She thus, the daughter of one of the most aspiring men
of the time, became allied to the two most powerful and ambitious families
in the kingdom&mdash;those of Northumberland and Howard. By this second
marriage, Margaret Audley (who died when only at the age of twenty-three)
became the mother of two sons&mdash;Lord Thomas Howard, afterwards created
Earl of Suffolk, of whom we shall speak presently, and Lord William
Howard, ancestor of the Earls of Carlisle, &amp;c.&mdash;and two daughters,
Elizabeth, who died in her infancy, and Margaret, who became the wife
of Robert Sackville, Earl of Dorset.</p>

<p>The elder of these sons, Thomas Howard, inherited Audley End and the
other family estates from his mother. Having, by Act of Parliament, 27th
of Elizabeth, been restored in blood, he was, in 1588, knighted for his
gallant behaviour in the engagement with the Spanish Armada, and in 1597
was created Baron Howard of Walden. “He was a brave sea officer, and
successively employed upon many trying occasions, sometimes as chief,
sometimes as second in command, during that reign, and in particular contributed
greatly to the reduction of the town and castle of Cadiz.” In 1597
he was installed Knight of the Garter, and, according to some accounts,
was made Constable of the Tower. On the accession of James I., Lord
Howard was, in 1603, sworn a Privy Councillor, created Earl of Suffolk, and
made one of the Commissioners for the office of Earl Marshal. In 1608 he
was appointed Lord Chamberlain, and in 1614 Lord High Treasurer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1115" id="Page_1115">[1115]</a></span>
England. He it was who, with Lord Monteagle, made the discovery of the
Gunpowder Plot while performing the routine business pertaining to his
office of Lord High Chamberlain on the 4th of November, 1605.</p>

<p>Lord Suffolk was married twice: first, to Mary, sister and co-heiress
of Thomas, Lord Dacres of Gillesland, by whom he had no issue; and,
secondly, to Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Henry Knevett, of
Charlton, and widow of Richard, eldest son of Lord Rich, by whom he had
four daughters&mdash;viz. Elizabeth, who married successively William Knolles,
Earl of Banbury, and Edward, Lord Vaux; Frances, married first to Robert
Devereux, Earl of Essex, from whom she was divorced, and next to Robert
Carr, Earl of Somerset, Margaret; and Catherine, married to William
Cecil, Earl of Salisbury&mdash;and eight sons, viz. Theophilus, who succeeded
him; Sir Thomas, who was created Earl of Berkshire, and is the direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1116" id="Page_1116">[1116]</a></span>
ancestor of the present Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire&mdash;the earldom of
Suffolk having reverted to this branch in 1733&mdash;whose descendants later on
succeeded to the titles; Henry, who married Elizabeth Bassett, of Blore, by
whom he had a daughter, Elizabeth, who became successively the wife of
Sir John Howard, of Swarkeston, in Derbyshire, and of William Cavendish,
Duke of Newcastle; Sir Charles; Sir Robert, “a gallant cavalier soldier,
was but too notorious in his own day for his intrigue with the Viscountess
Purbeck, the beautiful and ill-assorted daughter of the Chief Justice Coke;”
Sir William; Sir John; and Sir Edward, who was created Baron Howard
of Escrick.</p>

<p>The first Earl of Suffolk built the magnificent mansion of Audley End,
over which he is stated to have expended the enormous sum, for those days,
of more than £190,000. It is said of him that although he had, from his
many high and lucrative offices and his large estates, more ample means of
displaying his magnificence than had any of his ancestors, he eclipsed them
all in extravagance and show. His wife, Lady Suffolk, too, “was unfortunately
a woman of a covetous mind, and having too great an ascendancy
over her husband, used it in making him a party to her extortions on
persons who had business to transact at the Treasury, or places to obtain at
Court; and her husband was charged with embezzlement, deprived of his
office, and fined £30,000, but which was reduced by the King to £7,000. He
was generally considered to have been chiefly guilty in concealing the
malpractices of his wife, who eventually died in debt and difficulty.” Probably
one great reason for these things being laid to his charge was that,
through having for a son-in-law the fallen and disgraced courtier Robert
Carr, Earl of Somerset, he had become obnoxious to the new favourite,
Buckingham, through whose influence it appears he and his countess were,
for a short time, committed to the Tower. He died at Suffolk House (where
Suffolk Street, Strand, now stands), in 1626, and was buried at Walden.
He was succeeded by his eldest son, Theophilus Howard (who during his
father’s lifetime had been summoned to Parliament as Lord Howard of
Walden) as second Earl of Suffolk. He was a Knight of the Garter, Lord
Warden, Chancellor, and Admiral of the Cinque Ports, Constable of Dover
Castle, &amp;c., and married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of the Earl of
Dunbar, by whom he had issue four sons and five daughters, three of the
sons becoming successively Earls of Suffolk.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his son James (third Earl of Suffolk), who, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1117" id="Page_1117">[1117]</a></span>
his father, for a time resided at Audley End in quiet retirement. The cost
of the building had so greatly involved the first earl that, at the time of his
committal to the Tower, he was about £40,000 in debt, although he had
then but recently sold the Charter House to Mr. Sutton for £13,000, and
his property at Aynhoe, in Northamptonshire, for a considerable sum. The
charges thus entailed on the estate, and the cost of maintaining it, so
affected his successors that they were unable to support an establishment
commensurate with the size and magnificence of the house. After the
Restoration, Earl James, therefore, gladly took the opportunity which
offered of selling the park and mansion of Audley End to the King,
Charles II.</p>

<p>The purchase-money of this estate (which, as already stated, in building
alone had cost £190,000) was £50,000, of which but £30,000 was paid by
the King, the remaining £20,000 being left on mortgage. This was in
1666, and in 1670 the Court was regularly established at Audley End; the
Queen very frequently resided there; and, being convenient for Newmarket,
festivities were kept up on a large scale.</p>

<p>After the sale of the house, the Earl of Suffolk and his successor,
the fourth earl, resided in comparative retirement, Audley End being, by
the King, “committed to the charge of one of the family, who held the
office of housekeeper and keeper of the wardrobe, with a salary; and this
arrangement continued till 1701, when the house and park were reconveyed”
back to the Suffolk family. The £20,000 left on mortgage continued unpaid
by the King at the revolution of 1688, “nor is it clear that any interest had
ever been paid upon it” during the many years it had remained. In 1701,
therefore, the demesne was, as just stated, conveyed back to the Howards,
the fifth Earl of Suffolk, on receiving it, relinquishing his claim on the
Crown for the debt.</p>

<p>James, the third Earl of Suffolk, already spoken of, married, first,
Susan, daughter of the Earl of Holland, by whom he had an only daughter,
Essex, married to Edward, Lord Griffin of Braybrooke; secondly, Barbara,
daughter of Sir Edward Villiers and widow of Sir Richard Wenman, by
whom he had a daughter, who became the wife of Sir Thomas Felton; and,
thirdly, to Anne, daughter of the Earl of Manchester, by whom he had no
issue. Dying in 1688, he was succeeded by his brother, George Howard,
as fourth earl, who enjoyed the title only three years; when, dying without
surviving male issue, he was succeeded by his brother, Henry Howard, as
fifth earl. This nobleman married twice: first, Mary, daughter of Lord
Castle Stewart, by whom (besides a daughter) he had three sons&mdash;Henry,
Edward, and Charles&mdash;who each successively became Earl of Suffolk; and,
secondly, the widow of Sir John Maynard, by whom he had no issue. He
died in 1709, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Howard, created
in his father’s lifetime Baron Chesterford and Earl of Bindon, who was
succeeded by his eldest son, Charles William, as seventh Earl of Suffolk,
and second Earl of Bindon and Baron of Chesterford. He married Elizabeth,
daughter of Sir Thomas Astrey, but had no issue; and, dying in
1721-2, the titles of Baron of Bindon and Earl of Chesterford became
extinct, while those of Earl of Suffolk and Baron Howard of Walden
passed to his father’s brother Edward, and, at his death, to <i>his</i> brother
Charles, as ninth earl. He dying in 1733, left one only son, Henry
Howard, who thus became tenth Earl of Suffolk. This tenth earl married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1119" id="Page_1119">[1119]</a></span>
Sarah, daughter of Thomas Irwin, but died without issue in 1745, his widow
afterwards becoming the wife of Viscount Falkland.</p>

<p>On the death of the tenth earl, the title of Earl of Suffolk, &amp;c., passed to
his distant relative, Henry Bowes Howard, Earl of Berkshire, Viscount
Andover, &amp;c., who, descended from Sir Thomas Howard, second son of the
first Earl of Suffolk, was direct ancestor of the present Earl of Suffolk and
Berkshire, the barony of Howard de Walden remaining in abeyance
between the descendants of the two co-heiresses of the third earl.</p>

<p>These were, as already shown, Essex, wife of Edward, Lord Griffin of
Braybrooke, and Elizabeth, wife of Sir Thomas Felton. The representatives
of the elder of these were the Hon. Elizabeth Griffin, married, first, to Henry
Neville Grey, and, secondly, to the Earl of Portsmouth; and her sister, Ann,
wife of William Whitwell. Lady Portsmouth having no issue by either of
her husbands, the real descent lay with the son of Mrs. Whitwell, in whose
favour the abeyance terminated, and who thus became Lord Howard of
Walden. The possession of the Audley End estates was disputed by
Thomas Howard, second Earl of Effingham, who claimed under a settlement
in his favour, made by the seventh Earl of Suffolk, who, however, having
been proved to have himself only been a tenant for life, the claim was
disallowed, and the estates passed to Lady Portsmouth, from whom, by
bequest, they ultimately came to John Griffin Whitwell, Lord Howard
of Walden.</p>

<p>This nobleman was created Baron Braybrooke in 1788, with remainder
to his relative, Richard Neville, whose father, Richard Aldworth, was
maternally descended from the Nevilles; and, dying without issue, the title
of Lord Howard of Walden passed to a distant descendant of that family.
He was succeeded, as second Baron Braybrooke, in 1797, by this Richard
Neville, who assumed the name of Griffin. He married, in 1780, Catherine,
daughter of the Right Hon. George Grenville, who was maternally
descended from Theophilus, second Earl of Suffolk, and sister of the first
Marquis of Buckingham, and had by her, besides other issue, the Hon.
Richard, who succeeded him, and who, by arrangement with the deceased
peer’s only sister and heiress (wife of the Rev. Dr. Parker), obtained immediate
possession of the mansion and unentailed portion of the estate, the
other portion coming to him at the death, without issue, of that lady.</p>

<p>Richard, third Baron Braybrooke, born in 1783, succeeded his father in
1825, and married the Lady Jane, eldest daughter of Charles, Marquis
Cornwallis, by whom he had issue five sons&mdash;Richard Cornwallis Neville,
Charles Cornwallis Neville, Henry Aldworth Neville, Rev. Latimer Neville
(now Master of Magdalen College, Cambridge, and heir-presumptive to the
title), and Grey Neville&mdash;and three daughters. Lord Braybrooke was well
known as the author of the “History of Audley End,” and as the editor
of the “Diary and Correspondence of Samuel Pepys.” He was succeeded
by his eldest son, Richard Cornwallis Neville (better known as the Hon.
R. C. Neville), as fourth Baron Braybrooke. This nobleman, who was
born in 1820, was an eminent antiquary, and was author of several important
works. He was educated at Eton, and in 1837 entered the army,
serving in Canada till 1838. Ill-health, which continued throughout his
life, compelled him to retire from the army in 1841, and he devoted himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1121" id="Page_1121">[1121]</a></span>
thenceforward to the study of history and antiquities. He became a Fellow
of the Society of Antiquaries, a member of other learned bodies, and
contributed many papers to the <i>Archæologia</i> and to the <i>Transactions of the
Archæological Association</i> and <i>Institute</i>. Having undertaken and carried out
some important excavations at Chesterford, &amp;c., he published his “Antiqua
Explorata,” which afterwards he followed by another volume, “Sepulchra
Exposita.” In 1852 he issued his great work, “Saxon Obsequies;” and,
later still, the “Romance of the Ring; or, the History and Antiquity of
Finger Rings.” His lordship married, in 1852, the Lady Charlotte Sarah
Graham Toler, sixth daughter of the second Earl of Norbury (who afterwards
married Frederick Hetley, Esq., and died in 1867), by whom he left
two daughters, and, dying in 1861, was succeeded by his brother, the Hon.
Charles Cornwallis Neville, the present peer.</p>

<p>Charles Cornwallis Neville, fifth Baron Braybrooke, was born in 1823,
and educated at Eton and at Magdalen College, Cambridge, of which he is
Hereditary Visitor. In 1849 he married the Hon. Florence Priscilla Alicia
Maude, third daughter of the third Viscount Hawarden, by whom he has
issue one daughter, the Hon. Augusta Neville, born 1860. The heir-presumptive
to the title is, therefore, his brother, the Rev. Latimer Neville,
Master of Magdalen College, Cambridge, and Chaplain to the Bishop of
Rochester, who is married to Lucy Frances, eldest daughter of John Le
Marchant, Esq., by whom he has issue.</p>

<p>Lord Braybrooke is patron of seven livings&mdash;viz. Arborfield, Waltham
St. Lawrence, and Wargrave, in Berkshire; Shadingfield, in Sussex; and
Littlebury, Saffron Walden, and Heydon, in Essex. His arms are&mdash;quarterly,

<p>The history of Audley End has been pretty fully told in the history of
the families to whom it has belonged; but little, therefore, need be added.
The architect of the mansion has been variously stated to be Bernard Jansen
and John Thorpe, but the weight of evidence seems to be in favour of the
latter. Regarding the house itself, and especially the “admirable drink”
kept in the cellar, we have two striking pictures written by “quaint old
Pepys” in 1659-60 and 1667. “Up by four o’clock,” he says on the 27th
February, “Mr. Blayton and I took horse and straight to Saffron Walden,
where, at the White Hart, we set up our horses, and took the master of the
house to show us Audley End House, who took us on foot through the park,
and so to the house, where the housekeeper showed us all the house, in which
the stateliness of the ceilings, chimney-pieces, and form of the whole was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1123" id="Page_1123">[1123]</a></span>
exceedingly worth seeing. He took us into the cellar, where we drank
most admirable drink, a health to the king. Here I played on my flageolette,
there being an excellent echo. He shewed us excellent pictures; two
especially, those of the Four Evangelists, and Henry VIII. After that I
gave the man 2<i>s.</i> for his trouble and went back again. In our going, my
landlord carried us through a very old hospital, or almshouse, where forty
poor people was maintained; a very old foundation: and over the chimney-piece
was an inscription in brass, ‘Orate pro animâ Thomæ Bird,’ &amp;c., and
the poor-box also was on the same chimney-piece, with an iron door and
locks to it, into which I put 6<i>d.</i> They brought me a draft of their drink in
a brown bowl tipt with silver,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> which I drank off, and at the bottom was a
picture of the Virgin and the Child in her arms, done in silver. So we
went to our Inn, and after eating of something, and kissed the daughter of
the house, she being very pretty, we took leave, and so that night, the road
pretty good, but the weather rainy, to Epping, where we sat and played
a game at cards, and after supper and some merry talk with a playne
bold mayde of the house we went to bed.” Again, in 1667, he says:
“I and my wife and Willet (the maid), set out in a coach I have hired
with four horses, and W. Hewer and Murford rode by us on horseback;
and before night come to Bishop’s Stortford. Took coach to Audley
End, and did go all over the house and gardens; and mighty merry we
were. The house indeed do appear very fine, but not so fine as it hath
heretofore to me; particularly, the ceilings are not so good as I always took
them to be, being nothing so well wrought as my Lord Chancellor’s are;
and though the figure of the house without be very extraordinary good, yet
the stayre-case is exceeding poore; and a great many pictures, and not
one good one in the house but one of Henry VIII., done by Holbein; and
not one good suit of hangings in all the house, but all most ancient things,
such as I would not give the hanging up of in my house; and the other
furniture, beds, and other things, accordingly. Only the gallery is good,
and above all things the cellars, where we went down and drank of much
good liquor. And indeed the cellars are fine: and here my wife and I did
sing to my great content. And then to the garden, and there eat many
grapes, and took some with us; and so away thence exceeding well satisfied,
though not to that degree that by my old esteem of the house I ought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1124" id="Page_1124">[1124]</a></span>
did expect to have done, the situation of it not pleasing me; thence away to
Cambridge, and did take up at the Rose.”</p>

<p>Evelyn, who wrote a little before Pepys&mdash;in 1654&mdash;says he “went to
Audley End, and spent some time in seeing that goodly palace, built by
Howard, Earl of Suffolk, once Lord Treasurer. It is a mixed fabric ‘twixt
ancient and modern, but observable for its being completely finished; and it
is one of the stateliest palaces in the kingdom. It consists of two courts,
the first very large, winged with cloisters. The front hath a double
entrance; the hall is faire, but somewhat too small for so august a pile;
the kitchen is very large, as are the cellars, arched with stone, very neat,
and well disposed. These offices are joyned by a wing out of the way very
handsomely. The gallery is the most cheerful, and, I think, one of the best
in England; a faire dining-roome and the rest of the lodginges answerable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1125" id="Page_1125">[1125]</a></span>
with a pretty chapel. The gardens are not in order, though well inclosed;
it has also a bowling-alley, and a nobly walled, wooded, and watered park.
The river glides before the palace, to which is an avenue of lime-trees; but
all this is much diminished by its being placed in an obscure bottom. For
the rest it is perfectly uniform, and shows without like a diadem, by the
decoration of the cupolas and other ornaments on the pavilions. Instead of
railings and ballusters, there is a bordure of capital letters, as was lately

<p>In 1721, on the advice of that man of little taste, Sir John Vanbrugh the
architect, the three sides of the grand quadrangle, which formed so magnificent
an entrance to this splendid mansion, were destroyed, along with the
kitchen and offices, which were behind the north wing. The chapel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1126" id="Page_1126">[1126]</a></span>
cellars, which projected from the gallery wing at each end, soon shared the
same fate. The inner court thus was alone allowed to remain untouched,
and the mansion was confined to one hollow square. In 1747 the house
was in a state of dilapidation, and projects were set on foot both for pulling
it down, and for converting it into a silk manufactory. Two years later,
the eastern wing, whose feature was the magnificent gallery, was pulled
down. The house was, at an enormous expense, restored, repaired, and
made habitable by the first Lord Braybrooke, and, though there remains
but a small portion of the original edifice, it is yet a noble and stately
building.</p>

<p>We have left ourselves scant space for a description of the noble and
very beautiful house, one of the best of those of the Elizabethan era that
time has left us, though it is not now as it was when Evelyn pictured
it in the quotation we have given; but the gardens are charmingly kept,
and have been laid out with taste and skill; the classic river Cam runs in
front, and it is here of considerable breadth, Art having utilised the small
stream, and made what is technically termed “a sheet of ornamental
water;” it is also used to supply fountains and <i>jets d’eau</i> in various parts of
the grounds.</p>

<p>The house is distant about a mile from the pretty and picturesque town
of Saffron Walden, whose Church holds rank among four of the most
perfect examples in Great Britain; and close to it is a Museum containing
much that is deeply interesting&mdash;many specimens of the earliest races by
whom this island was inhabited in the pre-historic ages.</p>

<p>We give several engravings of the house; one of its principal Lodge,
one of its attractive Gardens, and one of a comparatively modern structure
in the grounds, called the Temple of Concord, built, it is said, to commemorate
the recovery of George III. from his first afflicting illness.</p>

<p>Before we reach the house, proceeding from the Audley End station,
we may pause awhile to examine the Abbey Farm-buildings and a square
of venerable and very comfortable Almshouses, in which “nine old ladies”
are passing in ease the residue of their lives&mdash;blessing, as we bless, the
lord who founded them.</p>

<p>The grand feature of the house is the Hall: it is not, as Evelyn thought
it was, “somewhat too small,” but is finely proportioned, in some parts
admirably carved, and it contains many portraits&mdash;among others that of the
founder and his wife and daughter. The ceilings throughout the mansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1127" id="Page_1127">[1127]</a></span>
are of much beauty, and, besides several grand examples of the ancient
masters and “throngs” of family portraits, there are some rare specimens of
china. There are other curious relics&mdash;among them the chair of Alexander
Pope, and the carved oak head of Cromwell’s bed, converted into a chimney-piece.</p>

<p>Audley End is not often visited: it is somewhat out of the highway of
England, but of a surety it will largely repay those who love Nature and
appreciate Art, and who rejoice that one of the grandest and most beautiful
of our landmarks of family history is yet in its perfection and thoroughly
“well cared for.”</p>

<p class="dc16 p4">“BURLEIGH HOUSE by Stamford town,”
as Tennyson has it in his simple and
beautiful ballad, “The Lord of Burleigh,”
stands in a noble park just
outside the fine old town of Stamford.
Stamford is in two counties&mdash;Lincolnshire
and Northamptonshire&mdash;on the river
Welland, which here divides them, and at
the same time separates six parishes, five
being in Lincolnshire, and the sixth, St.
Martin’s, or Stamford-Baron, in Northamptonshire.
In this latter county are Burleigh
House and its surrounding demesne. The
park for pedestrians is conveniently entered
at Burleigh Lane, one of the outer streets
of the town; thus the grounds, being so
ready of access, are an incalculable boon
to the inhabitants. The principal Lodges
are on the North Road, immediately south of St. Martin’s,
and are noble and important buildings, erected in 1801
at a cost of more than £5,000, by the tenth earl, the
approach being greatly improved in 1828 by his immediate
successor.</p>

<p>The park, nearly seven miles in circumference, was planted by “Capability
Brown,” and besides its attractions of wood and temples, grottoes and
other buildings, contains a fine sheet of water three-quarters of a mile in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1129" id="Page_1129">[1129]</a></span>
length, spanned by a handsome bridge of three arches, with noble sculptures
of lions. The Roman road, Ermine Street, may be traced in some parts of
the park on its way from Caistor to Stamford. The park, which contains
about fourteen hundred acres, was principally laid out by the first Lord
Burleigh, but has been since then considerably extended and improved,
one of the greatest improvements being the filling up of the fish-pond, and
the formation of the serpentine lake on the south front. The house is a
mile distant from the Grand Lodge entrance, the approach being, for a
considerable distance, among magnificent oak and other forest trees, through
beautiful upland scenery.</p>

<p>In the reign of Edward the Confessor, Burleigh (variously spelled
Burleigh, Burghley, and Burley) was let to farm by the Church at Burgh to
Alfgar, the King’s chaplain, at whose death it was seized by the Crown, and
afterwards redeemed for eight marks by Abbot Leofric, and was confirmed
to Peterborough Abbey in 1146. At the time of taking the Domesday
survey it was held of the Abbot of Peterborough by Goisfrid. In the reign
of Henry III. it is stated to have been in like manner held by Thomas de
Burghley, who died in 1280, and remained in that family for two or three
generations. “Peter de Burlegh, it appears,” says Sharpe, “held possession
here in the twenty-fourth of Edward I., and obtained a grant of
free warren in the third of Edward II. Geoffry, his son, succeeded him,
but, dying without issue, his widow, Mariot, married John de Tichmersh,
who, in her right, held the manor in the third of Edward III., and continued
to do so until the twentieth year of the same reign.” Somewhat later
it is said to have belonged to Nicholas de Segrave, it “having descended to
Alice de Lisle as part of the inheritance of John de Armenters. From
Nicholas de Segrave it passed to Warine de Lisle, who, with others, took
up arms against the king, was defeated at Borough Bridge, and executed at
Pontefract. By Edward III., Gerard de Lisle, son of Warine, was restored
to his father’s possessions, and held Burleigh with the other estates.” In
1360, Sharpe states, Burleigh was in the possession of Robert Wykes, one
of whose descendants, Margaret Chambers, sold it to Richard Cecil, father
of the Lord Treasurer, who also purchased the adjoining manor of Little
Burleigh.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Burleigh House, from the Park.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The present mansion was commenced in 1575 by the first Lord Burleigh,
whose principal residence was, however, at Theobalds, in Hertfordshire.
The old structure was mainly retained, the existing portions being
“in the eastern part of the present building, and are exceedingly fine and
substantial; they are&mdash;the kitchen, with a groined roof of vast extent and
most peculiar construction (perhaps the largest apartment in Europe
devoted to culinary purposes); the imposing banqueting-hall, with its
magnificent bay window and open carved roof, surpassed by only one other
in England (Westminster); and the chapel, reached by a unique vaulted
stone staircase, elaborately ornamented, and remarkable for its radiating
arch.” The building, when completed and finished, was said to be the
most complete and splendid in the kingdom. It is recorded that when,
in the civil wars, Burleigh was taken by the Parliamentarians, Cromwell
and his officers and army behaved with the utmost consideration and
courtesy to the family. Cromwell himself, “when he beheld it (Burlegh),
forgot his rage for destruction, and, charmed with its magnificence, displayed
his republican generosity by depositing his own picture (by
Walker) among those of its fine collection.” It is also recorded that later
on, William III., when he saw Burleigh, “with a jealousy and a littleness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1131" id="Page_1131">[1131]</a></span>
of spirit unworthy of a monarch, declared that it was much too gorgeous
for a subject.”</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth delighted to visit Burleigh; and we read that “twelve
times did he (Lord Treasurer Cecil) entertain the Queen at his house for
several weeks together, at an expense of £2,000 or £3,000 each time.” It
is traditionally said that on one of her visits, when the Lord Treasurer was
pointing out its beauties to Elizabeth, her Majesty, tapping him familiarly
on the cheek, said to him, “Ay, <i>my</i> money and <i>your</i> taste have made it a
mighty pretty place!” Burleigh was, in 1603, visited by King James I.
on his way from Scotland, and in 1695 by King William III. The most
magnificent royal visit was, however, that of Queen Victoria with the Prince
Consort in 1842, when she was accompanied by her ministers and the
Court.</p>

<p>The family of Cecil seems to be derived from Robert ap Seisylt, or
Sitsilt, or Seisel, a Welsh chieftain, who, in 1091, assisted Robert Fitzhamon
in his conquest of Glamorganshire, for which he received a grant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1132" id="Page_1132">[1132]</a></span>
lands in that county. Without entering particularly into the genealogy of
the early members of this family, it will be sufficient for our present purpose
to say that fifteenth in succession from this Robert ap Seisylt was David
Sicelt, who, having joined the Earl of Richmond (Henry VII.) in Brittany,
was rewarded for his service by a grant of land in Lincolnshire. Under
Henry VIII. he “was constituted Water Bailiff of Wittlesey, in the county
of Huntingdon, as also Keeper of the Swans there and throughout all the
waters and fens in the counties of Huntingdon, Cambridge, Lincoln, and
Northampton for the term of thirty years; also, in the fifth of Henry VIII.,
he was made one of the King’s Sergeants-at-arms; and, having this employment
at court, obtained for Richard, his son and heir, the office of a page to
the Crown. Likewise, in the eighth of Henry VIII., he obtained a grant
for himself and son of the Keepership of Clyff Park, in the county of
Northampton; and in the fifteenth of Henry VIII. (continuing still Sergeant-at-arms)
was constituted Sheriff of the King’s Lordship of Coly Weston, in
that county; and was Escheator of the county of Lincoln from November
15th, 1529, to November 15th following. In the twenty-third of Henry VIII.
he was constituted Sheriff of Northampton; and having been three times
Alderman of Stamford,” departed this life in the year 1541. He married
the heiress of John Dicons, of Stamford, by whom he had a son, Richard
Cecil, who succeeded him.</p>

<p>This Richard Cecil, as a page, attended Henry VIII. at the Field of the
Cloth of Gold, and afterwards became Groom and Yeoman of the Robes,
Constable of Warwick Castle, Bailiff of Whittlesea Mere, with the custody
of swans, and steward of several manors. He purchased the manors of
Burleigh and Little Burleigh, and had grants of land at Maxey, Stamford,
&amp;c. He married Jane, daughter and heiress of William Heckington, of
Bourn, by whom he had, with other issue, a son, William Cecil, the famous
Lord Treasurer.</p>

<p>This William Cecil, first Lord Burleigh, was born in 1520 at his mother’s
house at Bourn, and early received marks of royal favour under Henry VIII.
Under Edward VI. and Queen Elizabeth he held, with other offices, that of
Secretary of State; and by the latter was made Lord High Treasurer of
England, and created Baron Burleigh of Burleigh, and installed a Knight
of the Garter. His lordship remained Lord Treasurer until within a few
days of his death in 1598. Lord Burleigh married twice, each time gaining
a large increase both to his fortunes and to his social and political influence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1133" id="Page_1133">[1133]</a></span>
His first wife, to whom he was married in 1541, was Mary, sister of Sir
John Cheke, who, within a year of their marriage, died, after giving birth
to his son and successor, Thomas Cecil. In 1545 he married, secondly,
Mildred, daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke, by whom he had, with numerous
other issue, a son, Robert Cecil, who was created Earl of Salisbury, and was
the progenitor of the present Marquis of Salisbury. Lord Burleigh died in
1598, and was succeeded by his son&mdash;</p>

<p>Thomas Cecil, second Baron Burleigh, who held many important offices,
and was, by King James I., in 1605, created Earl of Exeter. He married,
first, Dorothea, one of the co-heiresses of John Nevil, Lord Latimer, and by
her had issue five sons&mdash;viz. William, who succeeded him; Sir Richard,
whose son David also became Earl of Exeter; Sir Edward, who was created
Baron Cecil of Putney and Viscount Wimbledon; Christopher; and Thomas&mdash;and
eight daughters. Lord Burleigh married, secondly, a daughter of the
fourth Lord Chandos and widow of Sir Thomas Smith, by whom he had
issue one daughter.</p>

<p>William Cecil, third Baron Burleigh and second Earl of Exeter, married,
first, Elizabeth, only child of Edward, Earl of Rutland, by whom he had
issue an only child, William Cecil, who, in his mother’s right, became
Baron Roos, but who died without issue in his father’s lifetime; and,
secondly, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Drury. Dying in 1640, he
was succeeded by his nephew, David Cecil, as fourth Baron Burleigh and
third Earl of Exeter; he married Elizabeth, daughter of John, Earl of
Bridgewater; and, dying in 1643, was succeeded by his son, John Cecil, who
was only fifteen years old at his father’s death. He married, first, Lady
Frances Manners, daughter of the Earl of Rutland; and, secondly, Lady
Mary, daughter of the Earl of Westmoreland and widow of Sir Bryan
Palmes. By his first wife he had issue one son, John, who succeeded him;
David, who died young; and a daughter, Frances, married to Viscount
Scudamore. He died in 1687, aged fifty-nine, and was buried at Stamford.
John Cecil, who succeeded his father as sixth Baron Burleigh and fifth Earl
of Exeter, espoused Lady Anne Cavendish, only daughter of the Earl of
Devonshire and sister of the first Duke of Devonshire (widow of Lord Rich),
by whom he had issue, John, who succeeded him, and other children.</p>

<p>John Cecil, seventh baron and sixth earl, married, first, Annabella,
daughter of Lord Ossulston; and, secondly, Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress
of Sir John Brownlow, by whom he had, with other issue, John
and Brownlow, who succeeded as seventh and eighth earls. He died
in 1721. John Cecil, his eldest son, who succeeded on his father’s
death in 1721 as seventh earl and eighth baron, died unmarried in
1722, when the titles and estates devolved on his brother, Brownlow
Cecil, who thus became ninth Baron Burleigh and eighth Earl of
Exeter. This nobleman married, in July, 1724, Hannah Sophia, daughter
and heiress of Thomas Chambers, of Derby and London, a beautiful and
amiable woman, to whom a monument is erected in the gardens, bearing
the following touching lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Oh, thou most loved, most valued, most revered,</p>
<p class="pp7">Accept this tribute to thy memory due;</p>
<p class="pp6">Nor blame me, if by each fond tie endeared,</p>
<p class="pp7">I bring again your virtues unto view.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“These lonely scenes your memory shall restore,</p>
<p class="pp7">Here oft for thee the silent tear be shed;</p>
<p class="pp6">Beloved through life, till life can charm no more,</p>
<p class="pp7">And mourned till filial piety be dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1135" id="Page_1135">[1135]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">By this lady, who died in 1765, aged sixty-three, the Earl had issue three
sons&mdash;Brownlow Cecil, ninth Earl of Exeter; Thomas Chambers Cecil, whose
son ultimately became tenth earl; and David Cecil&mdash;and two daughters,
viz. Margaret Sophia and Elizabeth (who became the wife of John Chaplin,
Esq.). His lordship died in 1754, and was succeeded by his son.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>East View.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Brownlow Cecil, tenth baron and ninth earl, succeeded to the titles and
estates in 1754, and having married Letitia, only daughter and heiress of
the Hon. Horatio Townsend, he died without issue in 1793, and was succeeded
in his title and estates by his nephew, Henry Cecil, only son of the
Hon. Thomas Chambers Cecil, by his wife, Charlotte Garnier.</p>

<p>Henry Cecil, eleventh Baron Burleigh, tenth Earl of Exeter, and first
Marquis of Exeter, was born at Brussels in 1754, and for many years in his
early life was M.P. for Stamford. His lordship was married three times:
first, to Emma, only daughter and heiress of Thomas Vernon, Esq., of
Hanbury, from whom he was divorced in 1791, after having issue by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1136" id="Page_1136">[1136]</a></span>
one son, Henry, who died young; secondly, to Sarah, daughter to Thomas
Hoggins, of Bolas, Shropshire, by whom he had issue four children, viz.
the Lady Sophia Cecil, married to the Hon. Henry Manvers Pierrepoint
(whose daughter married Lord Charles Wellesley, second son of the
first Duke of Wellington, and was mother of the present heir-presumptive
to that dukedom); Lord Henry Cecil, who died young; Lord Brownlow
Cecil, who became second Marquis of Exeter; and Lord Thomas Cecil, who
married Lady Sophia Georgiana Lennox; and, thirdly, to Elizabeth, Duchess
of Hamilton, by whom he had no issue. The second of these three
marriages has supplied a theme to many novelists and dramatists. They
have used the poet’s license somewhat; but it is certain that the bride and
her family had no idea of the rank of the wooer until the Lord of Burleigh
had wedded the peasant-girl. Thus Moore pictures Ellen, the “hamlet’s
pride,” loving in poverty, leaving her home to seek uncertain fortune.
Stopping at the entrance to a lordly mansion, blowing the horn with a
chieftain’s air, while the porter bowed as he passed the gate, “she believed
him wild,” when he said, “This castle is thine, and these dark woods all;”
but “his words were truth,” and “Ellen was Lady of Rosna Hall.”</p>

<p>The story is more accurately and more plaintively poetically told by the
Laureate Tennyson, who undoubtedly adheres more literally to fact when
he describes the lady as bowed down to death by the heavy weight of
honour laid upon her, “unto which she was not born.” Tennyson’s ballad
of “The Lord of Burleigh,” in which the story of the “village maiden,”
from her wooing when she was plain Sarah Hoggins to the time of her
early death as Countess of Exeter, is so sweetly and touchingly told, is too
sadly beautiful to be omitted here. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“In her ear he whispers gaily,</p>
<p class="pp7">‘If my heart by signs can tell,</p>
<p class="pp6">Maiden, I have watched thee daily,</p>
<p class="pp7">And I think thou lov’st me well.’</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“She replies, in accents fainter,</p>
<p class="pp7">‘There is none I love like thee.’</p>
<p class="pp6">He is but a landscape painter,</p>
<p class="pp7">And a village maiden she.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“He to lips that fondly falter</p>
<p class="pp7">Presses his without reproof,</p>
<p class="pp6">Leads her to the village altar,</p>
<p class="pp7">And they leave her father’s roof.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“‘I can make no marriage present,</p>
<p class="pp7">Little can I give my wife,</p>
<p class="pp6">Love will make our cottage pleasant</p>
<p class="pp7">And I love thee more than life.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1137" id="Page_1137">[1137]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“They by parks and lodges going,</p>
<p class="pp7">See the lordly castles stand;</p>
<p class="pp6">Summer woods about them blowing,</p>
<p class="pp7">Made a murmur in the land.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“From deep thought himself he rouses,</p>
<p class="pp7">Says to her that loves him well&mdash;</p>
<p class="pp6">‘Let us see these handsome houses,</p>
<p class="pp7">Where the wealthy nobles dwell.’</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“So she goes by him attended,</p>
<p class="pp7">Hears him lovingly converse,</p>
<p class="pp6">Sees whatever fair and splendid</p>
<p class="pp7">Lay betwixt his home and hers.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Parks with oak and chestnut shady,</p>
<p class="pp7">Parks and order’d gardens great,</p>
<p class="pp6">Ancient homes of lord and lady,</p>
<p class="pp7">Built for pleasure and for state.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“All he shows her makes him dearer;</p>
<p class="pp7">Evermore she seems to gaze</p>
<p class="pp6">On that cottage growing nearer,</p>
<p class="pp7">Where they twain will spend their days.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Oh, but she will love him truly,</p>
<p class="pp7">He shall have a cheerful home;</p>
<p class="pp6">She will order all things duly,</p>
<p class="pp7">When beneath his roof they come.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Thus her heart rejoices greatly,</p>
<p class="pp7">Till a gateway she discerns,</p>
<p class="pp6">With armorial bearings stately,</p>
<p class="pp7">And beneath the gate she turns;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Sees a mansion more majestic</p>
<p class="pp7">Than all those she saw before;</p>
<p class="pp6">Many a gallant gay domestic</p>
<p class="pp7">Bows before him at the door.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And they speak in gentle murmur,</p>
<p class="pp7">When they answer to his call,</p>
<p class="pp6">While he treads with footstep firmer,</p>
<p class="pp7">Leading on from hall to hall.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And, while now she wonders blindly,</p>
<p class="pp7">Nor the meaning can divine,</p>
<p class="pp6">Proudly turns he round and kindly,</p>
<p class="pp7">‘All of this is mine and thine.’</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Here he lives in state and bounty,</p>
<p class="pp7">Lord of Burleigh, fair and free,</p>
<p class="pp6">Not a lord in all the county,</p>
<p class="pp7">Is so great a lord as he.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“All at once the colour flushes</p>
<p class="pp7">Her sweet face from brow to chin;</p>
<p class="pp6">As it were with shame she blushes,</p>
<p class="pp7">And her spirit changed within.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Then her countenance all over,</p>
<p class="pp7">Pale again as death doth prove;</p>
<p class="pp6">But he clasp’d her like a lover,</p>
<p class="pp7">And he cheer’d her soul with love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1138" id="Page_1138">[1138]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“So she strove against her weakness,</p>
<p class="pp7">Tho’ at times her spirits sank,</p>
<p class="pp6">Shaped her heart with woman’s meekness</p>
<p class="pp7">To all duties of her rank.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And a gentle consort made he,</p>
<p class="pp7">And her gentle mind was such,</p>
<p class="pp6">That she grew a noble lady,</p>
<p class="pp7">And the people loved her much.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“But a trouble weigh’d upon her,</p>
<p class="pp7">And perplex’d her night and morn,</p>
<p class="pp6">With the burthen of an honour</p>
<p class="pp7">Unto which she was not born.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Faint she grew, and even fainter,</p>
<p class="pp7">As she murmur’d, ‘Oh, that he</p>
<p class="pp6">Were once more that landscape painter,</p>
<p class="pp7">Which did win my heart from me.’</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“So she droop’d and droop’d before him,</p>
<p class="pp7">Fading slowly from his side;</p>
<p class="pp6">Three fair children first she bore him,</p>
<p class="pp7">Then before her time she died.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Weeping, weeping late and early,</p>
<p class="pp7">Walking up and pacing down,</p>
<p class="pp6">Deeply mourn’d the Lord of Burleigh,</p>
<p class="pp7">Burleigh House by Stamford town.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And he came to look upon her.</p>
<p class="pp7">And he look’d at her and said,</p>
<p class="pp6">‘Bring the dress and put it on her</p>
<p class="pp7">That she wore when she was wed.’</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Then her people, softly treading,</p>
<p class="pp7">Bore to earth her body, drest</p>
<p class="pp6">In the dress that she was wed in,</p>
<p class="pp7">That her spirit might have rest.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Countess, whose story is thus so plaintively told, died on the 18th of
January, 1797, at the early age of twenty-four, and her portrait, preserved
in the house, cannot but interest every visitor. The Earl, her husband,
was in February, 1801, advanced to the dignity of Marquis of Exeter, and
in May, 1804, he died, and was succeeded by his son by this romantic and
happy, though brief, espousal.</p>

<p>This son, Brownlow Cecil, second Marquis and eleventh Earl of Exeter,
and twelfth Baron Burleigh, was only nine years of age when, on the
death of his father in 1804, he succeeded to the titles and estates. In
1824 his lordship married Isabella, daughter of William Stephen Poyntz,
Esq., by whom he had issue eleven children&mdash;viz. William Alleyne, Lord
Burleigh, the present Marquis of Exeter; a daughter, born in 1826; Lord
Brownlow Thomas Montague Cecil; Lady Isabella Mary Cecil, who died in
infancy; Lady Mary Frances Cecil, married to Viscount Sandon, M.P., heir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1139" id="Page_1139">[1139]</a></span>
to the earldom of Harrowby; Lord Edward Henry Cecil; Lady Dorothy
Anne Cecil, who died in infancy; Lord Henry Poyntz Cecil; a son, who
died as soon as born; Lord Adelbert Percy Cecil, to whom Queen Adelaide
stood as sponsor; and Lady Victoria Cecil, to whom her Most Gracious
Majesty Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort were sponsors, married to
the Hon. William Charles Evans-Freke, brother of Lord Carbery. His
lordship died in 1867, and was succeeded by his son&mdash;</p>

<p>The present noble peer, William Alleyne Cecil, third Marquis and
twelfth Earl of Exeter, and thirteenth Baron Burleigh of Burleigh, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1140" id="Page_1140">[1140]</a></span>
Privy Councillor, and Hereditary Grand Almoner of England, who was
born on the 30th of April, 1825, and was educated at Eton and St.
John’s College, Cambridge, where he graduated as M.A. in 1847. He
sat as M.P. for South Lincolnshire from 1847 to 1857, and for North
Northamptonshire from 1857 to 1867, in which year he succeeded to
the titles, and took his seat in the Upper House. In 1856 he was
appointed Militia Aide-de-camp to the Queen, and in 1866 was made
Treasurer of her Majesty’s Household. In 1867 and 1868 he was Captain
of her Majesty’s Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, and he
holds many local and other appointments. His lordship married, in 1848,
Lady Georgiana Sophia Pakenham, second daughter of the second Earl of
Longford, and has issue living&mdash;Brownlow Henry George Cecil, Lord
Burleigh, born in 1849, and married to Isabella, daughter of Sir Thomas
Whichcote, Bart.; Lord Francis Horace Pierrepoint Cecil, born 1851,
married to Edith, youngest daughter of W. Cunliffe-Brooks, Esq., M.P.;
Lord William Cecil, born 1854; Lord John Pakenham Cecil, born 1867;
Lady Isabella Georgiana Katharine Cecil, born 1853; Lady Mary Louisa
Wellesley Cecil, born 1857; Lady Catherine Sarah Cecil, born 1861; Lady
Frances Emily Cecil, born 1862; and Lady Louisa Alexandrina Cecil,
born 1864.</p>

<p>His lordship is patron of seventeen livings, five being in Rutland, one
in London, and eleven in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>The arms of the Marquis of Exeter, engraved on our initial letter, are&mdash;barry
of ten, <i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>; six escutcheons, three, two, and one, <i>sable</i>,
each charged with a lion rampant, <i>argent</i>. Crest&mdash;on a chapeau, <i>gules</i>,

House, Ryde, in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>The visitor to Burleigh House is admitted by the Porter’s Lodge into the
Outer Court, which is a quadrangle surrounded by the domestic and business
offices of the establishment. He then passes into the Corridor, decorated
with bas-reliefs by Nollekens, and so reaches the Great Hall, or Queen
Victoria’s Hall, a banqueting-room of magnificent size and of matchless
beauty, with open-work timber roof, stained-glass windows, richly carved
gallery, and royal and other portraits. This noble apartment, shown in the
accompanying engraving, which, with others of our series, is taken from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1141" id="Page_1141">[1141]</a></span>
photograph by F. Robinson, is 68 feet long, 60 feet in height, and 30 feet in
width, with, in addition, a deeply recessed bay window.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Great Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It has a magnificent
open timber-work roof of carved oak, and the lower portions of the walls are
wainscoted; and at one end is a music gallery, the cornice of the panelling
and the gallery being supported on a number of richly carved spiral
Corinthian columns. The fire-place is remarkably fine, and the window is
filled with stained glass. Among the pictures in the Hall are a portrait
of the Prince Consort in his Garter robes, presented to the Marquis by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1142" id="Page_1142">[1142]</a></span>
Prince; Dahl’s full-length portraits of George I., George II., and the Queen
of George II.; and portraits of Viscount and Viscountess Montague, Earl
of Peterborough, Sir Walter Raleigh, &amp;c. From the Hall, passing through
Vestibule and Corridor, which contain busts of the Cæsars and other
examples of sculpture, and the Ancient Stone Staircase&mdash;a part of the
original building, shown in the opposite engraving&mdash;the Chapel is reached.
The Chapel contains, among its other attractions, a fine assemblage of
carving, said to be by Grinling Gibbons, and among the best of his productions;
an altar-piece by Paul Veronese, the subject being the “Wife of
Zebedee;” the seat used by Queen Elizabeth when she worshipped here,
and used also for the same purpose by Queen Victoria; and many good
paintings. The communion-table and altar-rails are of cedar-wood, and the
pulpit and reading-desk of mahogany. The magnificent chimney-piece of
various marbles was brought from a convent near Lisbon. The Ante-chapel
is also an interesting room. The Chapel-room contains many paintings by
Carlo Dolce, Domenichino, Lanfranco, Albert Dürer, Guercino, Andrea
Sacchi, Parmigiano, the Carracci, Guido, Teniers, Bassan, Rubens, Carlo
Maratti, Bolognese, Giulio Romano, Le Brun, and others.</p>

<p>The Billiard-room, panelled with Norway oak and enriched with a
decorated ceiling, is hung with family and other portraits. Among them
are Lawrence’s full-length group portraits of the tenth Earl and Countess&mdash;Sarah
the “village maiden”&mdash;and their daughter, the Lady Sophia;
several other Earls and Countesses of Exeter, and others of their families;
the first Duke and Duchess of Devonshire; Barbara Villiers, Duchess of
Cleveland; Duchess of Montrose, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We will not, however, go through the various rooms in the order in
which they are visited, but select, here and there, an apartment for notice,
our object being, not to furnish a guide for the visitor’s use, but to give
a general sketch of the mansion and its surroundings.</p>

<p>The Ball-room has its walls and ceiling painted by Laguerre in his best
style, the subject of the latter being described as the “History of the
Planetary System.” On the east side of the walls is painted “The Battle of
Cannæ,” and on the west “The Continence of Scipio;” the others being
“The Loves of Antony and Cleopatra,” &amp;c. The Brown Drawing-room,
lined with oak, contains many valuable paintings as well as some exquisite
examples of Gibbons’s carvings, as also do the Black and Yellow Bed-rooms.
In this latter room is the ancient state bed from which it takes its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1143" id="Page_1143">[1143]</a></span>
name. This is hung with black satin, ornamented with fine old needlework,
and lined with yellow silk. In the windows is some good stained glass, and
over the chimney-piece a fine example of Gibbons’s carving. Among the
paintings in this and the West and North-west Dining-rooms are pictures
by Guercino, old Franck, Libri, Angelica Kauffmann, Rubens, Scilla,
Cimabue, Giordano, the Carracci, Elsheimer, Van Balen, Salvator Rosa,
Castiglione, G. Bolognese, Van Eyck, Murillo, Claude Lorraine, Domenichino,
Mola, Jordaens, and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1144" id="Page_1144">[1144]</a></span></p>

<p>In the China Closet, besides several good paintings, a case of ceramic
treasures is preserved.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth’s Bed-room is one of the most interesting apartments in
the mansion, “and presents almost the same appearance as on the day when
the great virgin queen first reposed therein&mdash;the very bed on which her
royal form reclined, the same rich ancient tapestry which then decorated the
walls, and the same chairs which then furnished the room, and upon some
of which Elizabeth herself was once seated. The bed is hung with dark
green velvet, embroidered with gold tissue, and the walls are hung with
tapestry representing Bacchus and Ariadne, Acis and Galatea, and Diana
and Actæon.” Queen Elizabeth’s Dining-room, or the Pagoda Room,
looks out upon the lawn, in the centre of which is a majestic and venerable
tree planted by the “Virgin Queen,” the “Good Queen Bess,” herself.
In this room are a Chinese pagoda and many interesting portraits and
other paintings. Among these are Shee’s portrait of the late marquis;
Cranach’s head of Luther; Holbein’s Henry VIII., Thomas Cromwell,
Edward VI., Queen Mary, Duke of Newcastle, and Queen Elizabeth; Mark
Gerard’s Queen Elizabeth and the Lord Treasurer Burleigh; Zucchero’s
Robert Devereux; Rembrandt’s Countess of Desmond; and admirable
examples of Van Eyck, Annibale Carracci, Velasquez, Titian, Cranach,
Paul Veronese, Cornelius Jansen, Dobsone, Vandyke, old Stone, Dance,
Romney, and others. The Purple Satin Rooms are also hung with
valuable paintings, and the furniture is of superb character.</p>

<p>The George Rooms, as a magnificent suite of five apartments,
occupying the south side of the mansion, are called, have the whole of
their ceilings painted with allegorical and mythological subjects by Verrio.
These are the apartments specially set aside for royalty, and have been
repeatedly so occupied. The first George Room has its floor of oak
inlaid with walnut, and the carvings over the doors are among the best
existing examples of Gibbons. The Jewel Closet has a similar floor and
equally good carvings; and in the centre, in a large glass case, are preserved
numerous jewels and curiosities of great separate and collective value.
“Here are a plate of gold, a basin, and spoons, used by Queen Elizabeth at
her coronation; a curiously ornamented busk, also used by Queen Elizabeth,
and a jewelled crystal salt-cellar, supposed to have belonged to that great
queen; a minute jewelled trinket sword, once belonging to the unfortunate
Mary Queen of Scots; a handkerchief of William III.; Cæsar’s head carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1145" id="Page_1145">[1145]</a></span>
in onyx (a choice antique, 2½ inches oval, and set in diamonds); Henry VIII.
and his children cut in sardonyx; the head of the Lord Treasurer Burleigh
on the back of an antique intaglio of Caracalla, depending from which
is a small head of Elizabeth, both cameo on onyx. There are, besides, a
multitude of enamelled trinkets, miniature vases in gold filigree, amber,
diamonds, precious stones, &amp;c., &amp;c. To this collection have been added, of
late years, a chrysanthemum wreath worn by Queen Victoria at the baptism
of the Lady Victoria Cecil, youngest daughter of the second marquis, and a
pair of white kid gloves worn by her Majesty at the same time: the wreath
has been incrusted with metal by a process of electro-gilding, but in effecting
this it was broken into several pieces. There is also a very elaborately
ornamented trowel, used by Prince Albert, in 1842, in the ceremony of laying
the first stone of the present building of the Royal Exchange, London, and
presented by him to the Marquis of Exeter, who attended his Royal Highness
at the time as Groom of the Stole. There are also here a magnificent
jewelled crucifix, several feet in height, and of great value, some rare
china, and other articles. One other object remains to be noticed in this
apartment: this is a beautiful specimen of carving in white wood of a
bird, nearly the colour and about the size of a canary: it is represented as
dead, hanging by one leg from a nail, and so exquisitely is it worked,
that looking upon it it is difficult to believe it merely the resemblance of
reality.”</p>

<p>The State Bed-room, or second George Room, is the bed-room set apart for
the repose of royalty, and its furniture and decorations are of great richness.
A magnificent bed was here erected by the then marquis, in preparation for a
visit from George IV. when Prince of Wales, and was subsequently several
times used by various members of the royal family; but when Queen
Victoria visited Burleigh in 1844, a bed even more rich and costly was substituted,
in which her Majesty and her royal consort, Prince Albert, reposed
during their stay. The hangings are of crimson velvet lined with white
satin. The walls are hung with rare tapestry.</p>

<p>The State Dining-room, and the Great Drawing-room, or fourth George
Room, are gorgeous in the extreme, and filled to repletion with choice
works of Art and antiquity; while the fifth of these George apartments,
named the Heaven, from the subjects of Verrio’s paintings, which cover
alike the ceiling and walls, contains cabinets, paintings, and busts of great
value. The whole of this suite of rooms is hung with choice pictures, of which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1146" id="Page_1146">[1146]</a></span>
of course, space prevents our giving an account. The Grand Staircase, leading
to the Great Hall, completes this suite; its ceiling is by Verrio, and the staircase
and landings are adorned with sculpture and paintings.</p>

<p>We regret that we cannot find space to describe the numerous other
admirably constructed and beautifully furnished apartments of this noble
mansion, one of the most interesting of the many glorious baronial halls of
the kingdom.</p>

<p>The burial-place of the family of Cecil is St. Martin’s Church, Stamford,
where many monuments exist; and the visitor will find much to interest him
in this and the other churches of that town.</p>

  <img class="dc1" src="images/ill-b147.jpg" width="200" height="453" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="dc14">HEVER CASTLE was originally the stronghold of
the family of De Hevre, said to have been of
Norman extraction, one of whom, William De
Hevre, is stated to have had license from King
Edward III. to embattle this his manor-house.
His daughters and co-heiresses inherited the
estates, and through them, by marriage, they were
conveyed to the families of Cobham and Brocas,
the former of whom, having obtained the whole by
purchase, sold it to Sir Geoffrey Bullen, or Boleyn,
in which family it remained until it was seized by
the Crown.</p>

<p>The family of Boleyn, or Bullen, traces from Sir
Thomas Bullen, Knt., of Blickling and Saul, in Norfolk,
and Joan, his wife, daughter and heiress of Sir
John Bracton, Knt. The grandson of Sir Thomas was
Sir Geoffrey Bullen, the purchaser of Hever Castle
and other estates of the De Hevre family. Sir Geoffrey
“was a wealthy mercer in London, as also Lord Mayor
of that city in 37 Henry VI., and, having married
Anne, eldest daughter and co-heiress to John, Baron
Hoo and Hastings, by his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of
Sir Nicholas Wichingham, he had issue, Sir William Bullen, Knight of
the Bath at the coronation of King Richard III.” Sir William married
Margaret, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Butler, Earl of Ormond
(third brother to James, Earl of Wiltshire), and by her had, with other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1148" id="Page_1148">[1148]</a></span>
issue, a son, Thomas Bullen, afterwards created Earl of Wiltshire and
Ormond.</p>

<p>This Thomas Bullen, or Boleyn, whose career, and that of his unfortunate
daughter, Queen Anne Boleyn, are so intimately woven into the
history of our country, was, in 1496, in arms with his father for suppressing
the Cornish rebellion; and, under Henry VIII., “being one of the
knights of the king’s body, was, jointly with Sir Henry Wyat, Knt.,
constituted governor of the Castle of Norwich. In the following year he
was one of the ambassadors to the Emperor Maximilian, touching a war
with France, and soon after was sole governor of Norwich Castle.”</p>

<p>In the eleventh year of this sovereign’s reign “he arranged the famous
interview of King Henry VIII. and Francis I. between Guisnes and Ardres,
and in the thirteenth year was accredited ambassador to the latter. The
next year, being treasurer of the King’s household, he was sent ambassador
to Spain, to advise with King Charles upon some proceedings in order to the
war with France.” In 1525, with a view to further the suit of the monarch
to his daughter Anne, Sir Thomas Bullen was created Baron and Viscount
Rochfort, and afterwards successively Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond,
a Knight of the Garter, and Lord Privy Seal. “He subscribed the articles
against Cardinal Wolsey in 21 Henry VIII., and soon after was sent again
ambassador to the Emperor Charles V.”</p>

<p>This Sir Thomas Bullen, afterwards, as we have shown, created Baron
Rochfort, Viscount Rochfort, Earl of Ormond, and Earl of Wiltshire, married
Elizabeth daughter of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and by her had
issue one son&mdash;George, commonly called Viscount Rochfort, but summoned
as Baron Rochfort during the lifetime of his father&mdash;and two daughters,
Anne and Mary. Lord Rochfort married Jane, daughter of Henry Parker,
Earl of Morley. He was beheaded during the lifetime of his father, and
left no issue. Of the daughters, the Lady Anne Bullen, who was created
Marchioness of Pembroke, became second queen to King Henry VIII.; and
the Lady Mary Bullen, married, first, William Cary, Esquire of the Body
to King Henry VIII., and brother of Sir John Cary of Plashley, one of
the gentlemen of the bed-chamber to the same monarch; and, secondly, Sir
William Stafford, Knt. The husband of this lady, William Cary, was
the son of Thomas Cary, of Chilton Foliat, in Wiltshire (son of Sir
William Cary, of Cockington, Devon, Knt.&mdash;who was slain at the battle
of Tewkesbury&mdash;by his second wife, Alice, daughter of Sir Baldwin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1149" id="Page_1149">[1149]</a></span>
Fulford), by his wife, Margaret, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Robert
Spencer, of Spencer Combe, by the Lady Eleanor Beaufort, daughter
of Edmund, and sister and co-heiress of Henry, Duke of Somerset.
Lady Mary Bullen had, by her first husband, William Cary, a daughter,
Catherine, married to Sir Francis Knollys, K.G.; and a son, Sir Henry
Cary, Knt., who was created Baron Hunsdon at the coronation of Queen
Elizabeth, and from whom descended the Barons Hunsdon and Earls of
Dover and Monmouth; while from his brother, Sir John Cary, of Plashley,
Knt., by his wife, Joyce, sister of Sir Anthony Denny, king’s remembrancer,
are descended the Viscounts Falkland.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Entrance Gateway, with Portcullis.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Anne Boleyn, or Bullen, was born at Hever in or about the year 1507;
and in 1514, when only seven years of age, was appointed one of the maids
of honour to the King’s sister&mdash;who had then just been married to Louis XII.
of France&mdash;and was allowed to remain with her when her other English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1150" id="Page_1150">[1150]</a></span>
attendants were unceremoniously sent out of the country. On the Queen’s
second marriage with Brandon, Anne Boleyn was left under the powerful
protection of the new queen, Claude, wife of Francis I. She was thus
brought up at the French Court. When war was declared against France
in 1522, at which time her father, Sir Thomas Boleyn, was ambassador to
that country, it is thought she was brought back to England by him, and,
shortly afterwards, was appointed one of the maids of honour to Queen
Catherine, wife of Henry VIII., and was thus brought under the notice of
that detestable and profligate monarch. She had not been long at Court
when, it is said by Cavendish, a strong and mutual attachment sprang
up between her and the young Lord Percy, son and heir of the Earl of
Northumberland, who made her an offer of marriage, and was accepted. At
this time she was only sixteen years of age. The match, however, was not
destined to be made, for the King “had already turned his admiring eyes in
the same direction, and, jealous of the rivalry of a subject, he caused the
lovers to be parted through the agency of Cardinal Wolsey, in whose household
Percy had been educated; and that young nobleman, probably under
compulsion, married, in 1523, a daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury.”
Anne, on being thus compulsorily separated from her young and fond lover,
was removed to Hever. Here, within a few weeks, she heard of the
marriage of her accepted lover, and, with feelings which can well be imagined,
kept herself secluded.</p>

<p>To Hever the King repaired on a visit, but probably suspecting the
cause of his arrival, Anne, under the pretext of sickness, kept closely to her
chamber, which she did not leave until after his departure. “But this
reserve was more likely to animate than daunt a royal lover; and Henry,
for the purpose of restoring the reluctant lady to court, and bringing her
within the sphere of his solicitations,” created her father Baron and Viscount
Rochfort, and gave him the important post of Treasurer of the Royal Household.
He also surrounded himself with her relatives and friends. Among
those who were his chief companions were her father, Thomas, Viscount
Rochfort; her brother George; her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk; her
cousin, Sir Francis Bryan; her near relative and admirer, Sir Henry Norris;
her intimate friend, Sir William Compton; and the King’s old favourite, the
Duke of Suffolk&mdash;a lively but dissolute society, not one of whom showed
any high regard for marriage vows, or treated their infringement as anything
but a jest. “Suffolk,” says Mr. Brewer, “had been betrothed to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1151" id="Page_1151">[1151]</a></span>
lady; then married another; then abandoned her, on the plea of his
previous contract, for the lady whom he had in the first instance rejected.
Norfolk lived with his duchess on the most scandalous terms. Sir William
Compton had been cited in the Ecclesiastical Court for living in open adultery
with a married woman. The fate of Norris and George Boleyn is too well
known to require comment. Sir Francis Bryan, the chief companion in the
King’s amusements, and the minister of his pleasures, was pointed out by
common fame as more dissolute than all the rest.” Sir Thomas Wyatt,
though married, wore her miniature round his neck, and sang of her love.
Still, however, Henry’s suit, which was dishonourable even to one so depraved
and lost to honour as he was, was unprosperous when made; and she is said
by an old writer, and one not favourable to her, to have replied firmly to the
King, “Your wife I cannot be, both in respect of my own unworthiness, and
also because you have a queen already; and your mistress I will not be.”
Foiled in his attempt to gain her by any other means, the unscrupulous
monarch now began seriously to set himself to the task of obtaining a divorce
from Queen Catherine, who had been his wife for seventeen years, in order
that he might replace her by Anne Boleyn. The history of these proceedings
is a part of the history of the kingdom, and need not be here detailed. It
is, however, a tradition of Hever that when the King came “a wooing” he
sounded his bugle in the distance, that his lady-love might know of his
approach. The divorce being obtained, Anne Boleyn, having previously
been married to the King, became “indeed a queen;” and having given
birth to two children&mdash;Queen Elizabeth and a still-born son&mdash;was arrested
on a false and disgraceful charge, and was beheaded, to make room for a
new queen in the person of one of her own maids of honour, Jane Seymour.</p>

<p>Of the personal appearance of Queen Anne Boleyn Mr. Brewer thus
pleasantly discourses:&mdash;“The blood of the Ormonds ran in her veins. From
her Irish descent she inherited&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">‘The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes.’</p>

<p class="pn1">And, like the Irish Isolt of the great poet, Anne Boleyn was remarkable
for the exquisite turn of her neck and her glossy throat. She was a little,
lively, sparkling brunette, with fascinating eyes and long black hair, which,
contrary to the sombre fashion of those days, she wore coquettishly floating
loosely down her back, interlaced with jewels. The beauty of her eyes and
hair struck all beholders alike&mdash;grave ecclesiastics and spruce young sprigs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1152" id="Page_1152">[1152]</a></span>
of nobility. ‘Sitting <i>in</i> her hair on a litter’ is the feature at her coronation
which seems to have made the deepest impression upon Archbishop Cranmer.
‘On Sunday morning (1st September, 1532), solemnly and in public, Madame
Anne being then at Windsor, <i>con li capilli sparsi</i>, completely covered with
the most costly jewels, was created by the king Countess of Pembroke.’
George Wyatt, grandson of Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet, one of her admirers,
describes her, in the fantastic language of the sixteenth century, as having
‘a beauty not so whitely as clear and fresh above all that we may esteem,
which appeared much more excellent by her favour passing sweet and cheerful.
There was found, indeed, upon the side of her nail upon one of her
fingers some little show of a nail, which yet was so small, by the report of
some that have seen her, as the work-master seemed to leave it an occasion
of greater grace to her hand, which, with the tip of one of her fingers, might
be and was usually by her hidden, without any least blemish to it.’”</p>

<p>The Earl of Wiltshire (Sir Thomas Boleyn), father of the ill-fated queen,
died in 1538&mdash;two years after witnessing the beheading of his only son,
Viscount Rochfort, and of his daughter, Queen Anne Boleyn; and on his
death the family of Boleyn, in the main line, became extinct.</p>

<p>After the death of the Earl, Henry, with the rapacity that kept pace
with his profligacy, claimed and seized the castle of Hever in right
of his murdered wife, and subsequently settled it upon one of his later
wives. He also purchased adjoining lands from others of the Boleyn
family, and thus enlarged the estate. The castle and manor of Hever, and
other adjoining lands, were settled upon Anne of Cleves, after her divorce,
for life, or so long as she should remain in the kingdom, at the yearly rent
of £93 13<i>s.</i> 3½<i>d.</i> She made Hever her general place of residence, and died
there according to some writers, but at Chelsea according to others, in 1557.
In “the same year the Hever estates were sold by commissioners, authorised
by the Crown, to Sir Edward Waldegrave, lord chamberlain to the household
of Queen Mary, who, on the accession of Elizabeth, was divested of all
his employments, and committed to the Tower, where he died in 1561.” The
estates afterwards passed through the family of Humphreys to that of
Medley.</p>

</div>

<p>In 1745 Hever Castle was purchased by Timothy Waldo, of London, and
of Clapham, in Surrey. The family of Waldo is said to derive itself,
according to Hasted, from Thomas Waldo, of Lyons, in the kingdom of
France, and was among the first who publicly renounced the doctrines of
the Church of Rome, “one of the descendants of whom, in the reign of
Elizabeth, in order to escape the persecutions of the Duke d’Alva, came
over, it is said, and settled in England.” In 1575 Peter Waldo resided at
Mitcham. His eldest son, Lawrence&mdash;according to Mr. Morris Jones, who
has made much laudable research into the history of the family&mdash;had issue,
by his wife Elizabeth, no fewer than fifteen children. Of these the twelfth
child, Daniel Waldo, is the one pertaining to our present inquiry. He was
a citizen and clothworker of London, and was fined as alderman and sheriff
in 1661. He married Anne Claxton, by whom he had issue nine children.
Of these the eldest son, Daniel Waldo, some of whose property was burnt
down in the great fire of London in 1666, married twice, and from him are
descended the Waldos of Harrow. Edward, the second son, became the
purchaser, after the fire, of the sites of the “Black Bull,” the “Cardinal’s
Hat,” and the “Black Boy,” in Cheapside, on which he erected a “great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1154" id="Page_1154">[1154]</a></span>
messuage,” where he dwelt; and in which, when it was taken down in 1861,
was some fine oak carving, now at Gungrog.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Hever Castle, from the West.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This Edward Waldo was
knighted&mdash;“at his own house in Cheapside,” the very house he had built&mdash;by
the King, who was his guest, in 1677. On this occasion “he had the
honour of entertaining his sovereign, together with the Princesses Mary and
Anne and the Duchess of York, who, from a canopy of state in front of his
house, viewed the civic procession pass along Cheapside on its way to Guildhall.”
Sir Edward married three times. He died at his residence at
Pinner in 1705, aged seventy-five, and was buried at Harrow. Nathaniel
and Isaac, third and fourth sons of Daniel Waldo, died unmarried.
Timothy, the fifth son, we shall speak of presently. Samuel, the sixth son,
citizen and mercer of London, and freeman of the Clothworkers’ Company,
married, first, a daughter of Sir Thomas Allen, of Finchley; and, secondly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1155" id="Page_1155">[1155]</a></span>
Susan Churchman; and had, among other issue, Daniel Waldo, one of whose
daughters, Sarah (married to Israel Woolliston), died at the age of ninety-eight,
leaving her cousin, Col. Sibthorpe, M.P., her executor; Isaac Waldo,
one of whose daughters, Sarah, married Humphrey Sibthorpe, M.D.,
Sheridan Professor of Botany, whose son, Humphrey Sibthorpe, M.P.
(father of Col. Sibthorpe, M.P.), assumed for himself and his heirs, by royal
sign-manual, the additional name and the arms of Waldo on inheriting the
property left him by his relative, Peter Waldo, Esq., of Mitcham and of
Warton.</p>

<p>Sir Timothy Waldo, to whom allusion has been made, the purchaser of
Hever Castle, was admitted attorney of the King’s Bench and solicitor in
Chancery in 1730; in 1739 he was under-sheriff of the city of London, and
he was a liveryman and the clerk of the Salters’ Company. In 1736 he
married Catherine Wakefield, and had by her an only child, Jane, who
married, in 1762, George Medley, Esq., M.P., of Buxted. Sir Timothy,
who was knighted in 1769, died at Clapham in 1786, his wife surviving
him, and dying in 1806, aged ninety-five.</p>

<p>Their sole daughter and heiress, Jane, wife of George Medley, inherited
all the property, including Hever Castle. She had no issue, and died in
1829, in her ninety-second year, leaving her large possessions, the
personalty of which was sworn under £180,000, to her cousin, Jane Waldo,
only daughter and heiress of Edward Waldo, of London, who administered
to the estate as cousin and only next of kin. This lady, who thus became
the possessor of Hever Castle, died at Tunbridge Wells in 1840, when
the family became extinct. The name of Waldo had, however, been taken
by royal sign-manual, in 1830, by Edmund Wakefield Meade, Esq., of
Newbridge House, Dawlish, son of Francis Meade, of Lambeth. Edmund
Meade-Waldo, Esq., became resident at Stonewall Park, near Hever Castle,
which memorable edifice is still in possession of this family. He married
Harriet, second daughter of Colonel Rochfort, M.P., by whom he left issue
two sons and one daughter; the eldest son and heir being Edmund Waldo
Meade-Waldo, Esq. The daughter, Harriet Dorothea, was married, in
1850, to the Rev. W. W. Battye, Rector of Hever, to which living he was
presented by his father-in-law.</p>

<p>There are few ancient houses in the kingdom more deeply interesting
to the curious occasional visitor than Hever; it does not, however,
convey ideas of grandeur or magnificence. It never could have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1156" id="Page_1156">[1156]</a></span>
large. Certainly at no period did it supply ample room to accommodate
the suite of a luxurious monarch; and there is little doubt that the visits
of the eighth Henry were made, if not secretly, without state, when he
went to woo the unhappy lady he afterwards&mdash;and not long afterwards&mdash;murdered.</p>

<p>In the small chamber of the ground-floor, which still retains its
minstrel’s gallery and its panelling of oak, was the bad king entertained by
his victims; and in a very tiny chamber slept in pure innocence the object
of his lust&mdash;a most reluctant bride and most miserable wife.</p>

<p>Yet Hever Castle was a stronghold, and a place well calculated for safety
in the troublous times in which it was built and embattled. It is surrounded
by a moat, across which a bridge leads to the entrance gateway. The
entrance is defended by a strong portcullis, composed of several large pieces
of wood laid across each other like a harrow, and riveted throughout with
iron, designed to be let down in case of surprise, and when there was not
time to shut the gate. To this succeeds an iron portcullis. It is followed
by an inner solid oaken door, riveted with iron, firmly bound with iron
pieces going the whole length across, and studded with iron knobs. A
wooden portcullis then follows. Immediately adjoining these are two guardrooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1157" id="Page_1157">[1157]</a></span>
in which a dozen men-at-arms might long dispute the passage of an
enemy.</p>

         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>Hever Castle: the Court-yard.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Over the external gate, directly under the battlements, a series
of machicolations project boldly forward: from these molten lead and other
deadly appliances and missiles could be poured and discharged on the heads
of assailants with terrible effect. Passing through these gates and beneath
the portcullises, the visitor enters a spacious court-yard, surrounded on all
its sides by the building. From this court-yard or quadrangle he enters
the old Dining-hall, where the racks for hunting-spears are still visible,
and where grotesque decorations will not fail to be noticed. In the
stained-glass windows are the arms of the Boleyns and the Howards. Near
this is the Chapel, and continuing along the passages are two rooms bearing
the names of Anne Boleyn’s Bed-room and Anne of Cleves’ Room. Anne
Boleyn’s Room “is really an interesting apartment, beautifully panelled,
and contains the original family chairs, tables, muniment box, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1158" id="Page_1158">[1158]</a></span>
is called Anne’s bed.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> To this apartment several ante-rooms succeed, and
the suite terminates in a grand Gallery occupying the whole length of the
building, in which the judicial meetings and the social gatherings of the
ancient family were held. It is about 150 feet in length, by 20 feet in
width, with a vaulted roof, and panelled throughout with carved oak. On
one side, placed at equal distances apart, are three recesses: the first,
having a flight of three steps, is fitted up with elbowed benches, where the
lord of the castle in old times held his courts, and where Henry VIII. is
said, on the occasions of his visits, to have received the congratulations of
the gentry; a second was occupied by the fire; and the third was used as
a quiet corner for the old folks, while the younger ones frolicked throughout
the mazes of the dance. At one end of the Gallery a trap-door leads to a
dark chamber, called the Dungeon, in which the family are believed to have
sheltered themselves in time of trouble, although it is manifest that the
height of the room, compared with that of the building, must have betrayed
its existence to even a careless observer.</p>

approached by a winding staircase in one of the towers. “About

</div>
<p class="dc16">WESTWOOD&mdash;one of the very finest,
most perfect, and most interesting
of the Elizabethan mansions that
yet remain in England&mdash;lies about
two miles from Droitwich, in Worcestershire,
and six or seven from
the “faithful city.” It stands in
its own grand old deer park of some
hundreds of acres in extent, and
studded with such an assemblage
of noble forest trees as is seldom
seen. The oaks with which the park
abounds are almost matchless for their
beautiful forms and for their clean
growth (for they are clear from moss or
other extraneous growth from bole to
crest), as well as, in some instances, for
their gigantic stature. One of these “brave
old oaks” in front of the mansion we had
the curiosity to measure, and found it to be no less than eighteen
yards in circumference of bole on the ground, and thirty-one feet in circumference
at three feet from the earth, with a stem hollowed by time. It is
one of the lions of the place, and looks venerable and time-worn enough to
have braved the tempests of a thousand years. Another oak, not far from
this, is one of the finest in England, having a clear trunk, without bend or
branch, “straight as a mast,” to some forty feet or more in height before a
single branch appears.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Entrance Lodge.</i></p>
</div>

<p>There are two Entrance Lodges to the park from the road leading from
Droitwich to Ombersley; the principal of these we engrave. Entering the
gates at this Lodge, the drive leads up the park to the mansion, which forms
a conspicuous and striking object in front, the house and its surroundings
being effectively situated on rising ground. Immediately in front of the
mansion is the Gatehouse, one of the most quaintly picturesque in the
kingdom. It consists of twin lodges of red brick, with ornamental gables
and hip-knobs, with a central open-spired turret covering the entrance
gates. The gates, which are of iron, and bear the monogram J P (for
John Pakington), are surmounted by an open-work parapet, or frieze, of
stone, in which stand clear the three garbs and the three mullets of the
Pakington arms. Over this rises the open tower before spoken of. Passing
through these gates, the drive sweeps up between the smooth grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1162" id="Page_1162">[1162]</a></span>
lawns to the slightly advanced front portico which gives access to the
mansion.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>Westwood, from the Main Approach.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Before we enter let us say a few words on the general design and
appearance of this unique and remarkable building. The general block-plan
of the house may be described as a combination of the square and
saltire, the arms of the saltire projecting considerably from the angles of
the square, and forming what may almost be called wings, radiating from
its centre&mdash;the whole of the surface of this general block-plan being cut up
with numberless projecting mullioned windows. The four projecting wings,
which, like the rest of the building, are three stories in height, are each
surmounted with a spire. Around the whole building runs a boldly carved
stone parapet, bearing the garbs and mullets of the Pakington arms,
alternating the one with the other, and producing a striking and pleasing
effect, while the mullets also appear on the ornamental gables, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1163" id="Page_1163">[1163]</a></span>
vanes and hip-knobs. The advanced porch, erected at a later period, is of
stone, and is in the <i>Renaissance</i> style; over its central arch is Jove on the
eagle; and in front of the main building, over the porch, are the Pakington
arms boldly carved.</p>

<p>Standing clear from the mansion, and at some distance in front of
the north-east and south-east wings, are two so-called “turrets.” These
are small residences, if they may so be termed, each three stories in
height, and each having two entrance doors. They are surmounted
with picturesquely formed spire roofs, covered with scale slating. Originally
there were four of these square towers&mdash;the two now remaining,
and two other corresponding ones at the opposite angles. They were
all four in existence in 1775, but two have since been removed. At that
time they were connected with the wings by walls, and then again
were connected with the Gatehouse and other walls in a peculiar and
geometrically formed device. A highly interesting and curious bird’s-eye
view of Westwood, drawn by Dorothy Anne Pakington in the
year above named, is preserved in the Hall, and shows the arrangement
of the ornamental flower-beds, terraces, fruit walls, &amp;c., with great
accuracy.</p>

<p>From the Gatehouse, on either side, an excellent fence of pillar and rail
encloses in a ring fence the mansion and its surrounding ornamental
grounds, and kitchen and other gardens. These pleasure-grounds, several
acres in extent, are admirably laid out, and planted with evergreens of
remarkably fine growth. The hedges, or rather massive walls, of laurel,
box, Portugal laurel, and other shrubs; the grand assemblage of conifers,
which here seem to find a genial home, and to grow with unequalled
luxuriance; and the cedars of Lebanon, yews, and numberless other evergreens,
form these grounds into one of the most lovely winter gardens we
have ever visited. Among the main features of these ornamental grounds
are the “Ladies’ Garden,” a retired spot enclosed in walls of evergreens
seven or eight feet in height, having on one side an elegant summer-house,
which commands a beautiful view of the Malvern Hills and of the rich
intervening country, and in the centre a sundial surrounded by a rosary and
beds of rich flowers; and the Lavender Walk, where, between a long
avenue of tall lavender-bushes, planted by the present Lady Hampton, the
elegant and accomplished successors of the “stately dames of yore” can
stroll about and enjoy the delicious scent. Another great feature is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1164" id="Page_1164">[1164]</a></span>
splendid growth of some of the trees&mdash;notably a Wellingtonia, nine feet
in girth at the ground, and fully thirty feet in height, and a magnificent
specimen of <i>Picea pinsapo</i>, measuring ninety feet in circumference of its
branches, and said truly to be the finest and most perfectly-grown tree of
the kind in the kingdom. The kitchen gardens are of considerable extent,
and well arranged, but there is no conservatory. Altogether the ornamental
grounds are of great beauty, and harmonize well with the character of the
building.</p>

<p>One of the great glories of Westwood is its water. It has three
lakes, the largest of which, no less than seventy acres in extent, forms
a grand feature in the landscape, and, with its many swans and the
numbers of wild fowl that congregate upon and around it, adds much to
the beauty of the park scenery. On one side the lake is backed up by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1165" id="Page_1165">[1165]</a></span>
a wood through which, on the banks, a delightful grassy walk leads to
the Boat-house, from whose upper rooms delightful views of land and water
are obtained.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Entrance Porch.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The principal apartments in this noble mansion are the Great Hall, or
Front Hall, as it is usually called; the Library, the Dining and Drawing
Rooms, the Saloon, the Grand Staircase, and the Chapel; but, besides these,
there are a number of other rooms, and all the usual family and domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1166" id="Page_1166">[1166]</a></span>
apartments and offices. To the interior, however, we can but devote a very
brief space.</p>

<p>The Entrance Porch (shown in the preceding engraving), on the north
front, opens into the Front Hall. This occupies the entire length of the main
body of the building from east to west, and is about sixty feet in length.
The entrance door is in the centre, and on either side are deeply recessed
mullioned and transomed windows, and there is a similar window at each
end. From one of the recesses a doorway and steps lead up to the Dining-room;
while from the other, in a similar manner, access is gained to the
Library. On the opposite side a doorway leads to the Grand Staircase.
This hall, one part of which is also used as a billiard-room, contains some
magnificent old carved furniture and cabinets, and the walls are hung with
family portraits. In the windows are a series of stained-glass armorial
bearings and inscriptions, representing the arms of Pakington and the
family alliances. These are:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pi6h p1">1413. Robert Pakington and Elizabeth Acton.</p>
<p class="pi6h">1436. John Pakington and Margaret Ballard.</p>

<p class="pi6h">“1844. John Somerset Pakington, Esq., created Bart. 1846, wedyd

<p class="pn1">Among the portraits in this fine old room are the present Lord Hampton;
the Earl of Strafford; Hester Perrott, daughter and sole heiress of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1167" id="Page_1167">[1167]</a></span>
Herbert Perrott, of Haroldstone, and second wife of Sir John Pakington,
Bart.; Sir John Perrott, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, 1583; Margaret
Pakington (afterwards Mrs. Dowdeswell), daughter of Sir John Pakington
of Hampton Lovett, the celebrated Recorder of Worcester; Sir John
Pakington, M.P. for Worcester from 1690 to 1727; Ursula, Lady Scudamore,
daughter of Sir John Pakington; and many others.</p>

<p>The Dining-room, which occupies the lower story of the north-east
radiating wing, has an effective geometrical ceiling, and its walls are hung
with family portraits. The Library similarly occupies the lower story of
the corresponding or south-east wing. It is a noble room, lined with a
large and valuable assemblage of books, and fitted and furnished in an
appropriate manner. The ceiling, whose geometric panelling and other
decorations are in high relief, bears among its other devices the mullet of
the family arms. In the Library are, among many other Art treasures, two
important historical pictures&mdash;contemporary portraits of Brandon, Duke of
Suffolk, and Mary, his wife, daughter of Henry VII., King of England, and
widow of Louis XII. of France&mdash;on panel.</p>

<p>The view from these rooms is truly magnificent. Immediately in front
is the enclosed space already spoken of, with its grass lawns, its broad
carriage drives, its luxuriant shrubberies; the ivy-grown and picturesque
towers, one on either side; the grand old Gatehouse, with its central open-work
tower, and picturesque boundary railings cutting it off from the park.
Beyond this is seen the park, with its herds of deer, its forest trees of
centuries of growth dotted about the landscape; its noble sheet of water, on
which swans and wild fowl abound; and beyond, again, the thickly wooded
confines of the grounds and the distant heights. Thus a view of imposing
loveliness and of vast extent is gained from the windows of this side of the
mansion. But, indeed, one of the main characteristics of Westwood is that,
from whatever point the mansion is seen, it forms a striking and a pleasing
object; and that, from whatever window one looks, a scene of surpassing
beauty is presented to the eye.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Grand Staircase.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Grand Staircase, of which we give an engraving, is a marked feature
of the interior of the house, and differs in general character from any other
with which we are acquainted. It is of four landings, and at each angle, as
well as in the intermediate spaces, standing clear to a considerable height
above the banisters, rises a Corinthian pillar with richly carved capital,
supporting a ball. The whole is of dark oak, and has a rich and singular
appearance. The series of these pillars and balls numbers thirteen. The
Staircase has a panelled oak ceiling, which forms the floor of the upper
gallery, from which the bed-rooms are gained. The walls of the Staircase
are hung with fine old portraits, and others of more modern date: among
them are the “Du<sup>sse</sup> Dou<sup>e</sup> de la Tremouille, née Princesse d’Orange,” 1626;
General Monk; Master Herbert and Miss Cecilia Pakington; and the late
Bishop Murray, of Rochester, full length, by Falconer. At the foot of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1169" id="Page_1169">[1169]</a></span>
Staircase is the Baron Marochetti’s admirable bust of Lord Hampton, before
that well-deserved title was conferred upon him. It bears the following
inscription:&mdash;“Presented to Lady Pakington by the Medical Officers of the
Royal Navy, in grateful acknowledgment of the benefits conferred upon
that department of H.M. service during the administration of the Right
Hon. Sir John S. Pakington, Bart., G.C.B., &amp;c., 1858-9.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Saloon.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From the landing at the head of the Grand Staircase access is gained,
on the one hand, to the Saloon and the apartments connected with it; and,
on the other, to Lady Hampton’s private rooms, the sleeping apartments on
the same floor, and to the staircase to the upper story.</p>

<p>The Private Chapel, approached from the foot of the Staircase, occupies
the wing at the opposite angle from the Library. Its ceiling is of oak,
and it is fitted with open seats, also of oak, with fleur-de-lis poppy-heads.
The stained-glass window, representing the Adoration and the Ascension, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1170" id="Page_1170">[1170]</a></span>
remarkably good in design and pure in colouring. On a bracket on the
wall is a splendid piece of sculpture, representing Mary Magdalene supporting
the dead Christ.</p>

<p>The Saloon&mdash;the principal internal feature of Westwood&mdash;occupies the
entire space, in the central block of building, over the Front Hall. It is a
noble and lofty apartment, lit by two deeply recessed large mullioned and
transomed windows to the front, and one, of equally large size, at each end.
The ceiling, although of a somewhat later period, is a marvellously fine
example of modelled plaster-work, the wreaths and festoons of flowers
standing out clear from the surface, and modelled true to Nature. It is
divided into ornamental panels, enclosing wreaths and festoons, and round
the room is a boldly moulded and richly decorated oak frieze. In the centre
of the side opposite the windows is a massive and elaborately designed oak
chimney-piece, reaching up to the ceiling. The pillars, and mouldings, and
panels, and, indeed, every part of this fine example of ancient Art, are
elaborately carved with arabesques and foliage; the mouldings and cornices
being likewise richly carved with grotesque figures and other characteristic
ornaments. In the centre panel, over the fire-place, is a fine contemporary
half-length portrait of King Henry VIII.</p>

<p>The walls are hung with grand old tapestry, and this, at three of the
corners, conceals the doors leading respectively to the Drawing-room, the
Staircase, and another apartment. The subjects of the tapestry, commencing
at the doorway from the Staircase, are&mdash;First, “Isaac, blind; Rebecca sends
Jacob for two kids.” Second, “Laban overtakes Jacob at Mount Gilead;
kisses his daughter.” Third, “Jacob kisses Rachel at the well, and removes
the stone from its mouth.” Fourth, “Jacob brings home the kids.” Fifth,
“Jacob meets his brother Esau, and bows at his feet.” Sixth, “Jacob
divides his flocks.”</p>

<p>The Drawing-room opens from the Saloon, and is over the Library: it is
an elegant room, with a ceiling of moulded pargetting in scrolls and foliage,
and is of great elegance in all its appointments. At the opposite end of the
Saloon a doorway opens into an apartment over the Dining-room. It is now
disused, but, with its panelled frescoed walls and beautifully decorated
ceiling, is an apartment of much interest.</p>

<p>The remainder of the rooms of this grand old mansion do not require
special notice; it is enough to say they are all full of interest, and that they
contain many pictures of value.</p>

<p class="dc13 p2">OF the many families of note upon which we
have treated in these pages, few are of
greater antiquity or possessed of more
historic interest than that of Pakington,
of which the Right Hon. Lord Hampton
is the head. It dates from Norman
times, and presents a long succession of
notables, whose history is that of the
various ages in which they lived, and moved, and
had their being. It is clear, from the foundation
of Kenilworth Monastery, that the family flourished
in the reign of Henry I., and from that time down
to the present moment its members have been among
the most celebrated men of the country. In the
reign of Henry IV. Robert Pakington died, and was
succeeded by his son John, who in turn was succeeded
by his son of the same name, who married
Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Thomas Washbourne,
of Stanford, and thus the family became
connected with the county of Worcester. By this
lady he had issue three sons&mdash;John, Robert, and Humphrey. The eldest of
these, John Pakington, was of the Inner Temple, and was constituted
Chirographer of the Common Pleas in the reign of Henry VII., and in the
next reign was made Lent Reader and Treasurer of the Inner Temple; and
in the same year (20 Henry VIII.) had a grant from the King “that he, the
said John Pakington, for the time to come shall have full liberty during his
life to wear his hat in his presence, and his successors, or any other person
whatsoever; and not to be uncovered on any occasion or cause whatsoever,
against his will and good liking; also that he shall not be appointed, called,
or compelled to take the order of knighthood, or degree, state, or order of a
baron of the Exchequer, serjent-at-law, or any office or encumbrance thereto
relating.”</p>

<p>In 1532, however, he was appointed serjeant-at-law, and received a discharge
so as to enable him to accept that office. Having been appointed a
justice of North Wales, he was, in 1535, commissioned to conclude and
compound all forfeitures, offences, fines, and sums of money due to the
King or to his late father, Henry VII. He received many other appointsovereign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1172" id="Page_1172">[1172]</a></span>
ments and honours, and was ultimately knighted. He received from the
a grant of all the manors belonging to the dissolved monastery of
Westwood, and thus that fine property came to the Pakingtons. At the
time of his death, in 1560, Sir John was seized of thirty-one manors, and
of much other land which he had purchased from seventy different persons.
Leland says that he resided “at a goodly new house of brick, called
Hampton Court, six miles from Worcester.” Sir John is variously stated
to have married Anne Rolle (widow of Tychebourne) and Anne Dacres.
Whichever of these is correct, he died without male issue, leaving his
estates divided amongst his two daughters&mdash;Ursula and Bridget&mdash;and his
two brothers, Robert and Humphrey.</p>

<p>His brother, Robert Pakington, was M.P. for the City of London in the
time of Henry VIII., and was murdered in the streets of that city in 1537.
By his wife, Catherine, daughter of Sir John Baldwin, Lord Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas (by his wife, a daughter of Dormer of Wycombe,
through whom the manor of Ailsbury came to the family), he had issue one
son&mdash;Sir Thomas&mdash;and three daughters.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Pakington, who was knighted by Queen Mary, succeeded to
the estates of the Pakingtons and Baldwins. He was sheriff of Worcestershire
in the 3rd of Elizabeth, and, dying in 1571, at Bath Place, Holborn,
was conveyed in great pomp to Ailsbury, the officers of the College of Arms
attending, and buried there in state. By his wife (who survived him, and
married, secondly, Sir Thomas Kitson, of Hargrave), Sir Thomas had,
with other issue, a son&mdash;Sir John, by whom he was succeeded&mdash;and three
daughters.</p>

<p>Sir John Pakington, the “Lusty Pakington” of Queen Elizabeth’s
Court, was an especial favourite of the “Virgin Queen,” and a man of
rank in his day and generation. It is said that “Good Queen Bess” “first
took notice of Sir John in her progress to Worcester, where she invited him
to attend her Court, where he lived at his own expense in great splendour
and reputation, with an equipage not inferior to some of the highest officers,
although he had no greater honour than Knight of the Bath, which was
conferred upon him in the lifetime of his father. He was remarkable for his
stature and comely person, and had distinguished himself so much by his
manly exercises that he was called ‘Lusty Pakington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1173" id="Page_1173">[1173]</a></span>’”</p>

<p>“Having by his expensive
life contracted great debts, he took the wise resolution of retiring into
the country, and said he would feed on bread and verjuice until he had made
up for his extravagances; which coming to the royal ear, the queen gave
him a grant of a gentleman’s estate in Suffolk, worth eight or nine hundred
pounds a year, besides goods and chattels, which had been escheated to the
Crown; but after he had been in the country to take possession, he could not
behold the miseries of the distressed family without remorse and compassion;
and the melancholy spectacle of the unhappy mother and her
children wrought so effectually upon his fine feelings, that he repaired to
court immediately, and humbly besought the queen to excuse him from
enriching himself by such means, and did not leave the presence until he
had obtained his request, which involved the restoration of the property to
the rightful owner. Soon after this he left the court, but not before he had
liquidated all his debts, and then, with great reputation and honour, he
commenced his journey into the country, being handsomely attended by
servants and tenants to the number of sixty, well mounted and appointed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1174" id="Page_1174">[1174]</a></span>
who came purposely from his estates to pay him this compliment, and waited
at the court gates while he was taking leave of the queen. After settlement
in the country, Elizabeth granted him for sixty years (in the 25th of her
reign), for his good and faithful services, several lordships, manors, and
lands which had fallen to the Crown, in no less than seventeen counties.
He was also constituted lieutenant and <i>Custos Rotulorum</i> of Worcestershire,
and appointed bowbearer of Malvern Chase, one of the best in England,
which he retained until he had finished his noble park at Hampton Lovet;
and then, that chase being at too great a distance from his dwelling, he
obtained the queen’s leave to dispose of it. He was in Elizabeth’s favour
to the end, as appears as well from other evidence as from a grant she made
him for eight years (in the 40th year of her reign, he paying into the
Exchequer £40 per annum) that no one should import into the kingdom, or
make any starch, but by his permission. By his affability and obliging
deportment he acquired the good opinion of his equals and inferiors, and by
his courage and resolution on occasions requiring the exercise of those
attributes, he became formidable to persons in power. A memorable
instance of this occurred when he executed the office of sheriff for his
county. The Lord Chief Baron Periam having committed a gentleman at
the assizes, Sir John, sitting in his sheriff’s seat, called to him to stay,
telling the judge he would answer for his forthcoming; neither could he be
dissuaded by all the menaces he received, boldly alleging in his defence that
the gentleman was his prisoner, and he as sheriff was accountable for him.
Sir John is said on one occasion to have betted with three courtiers to swim
against them from Westminster, <i>i.e.</i> Whitehall Stairs, to Greenwich for a
stake of £3,000; but Queen Elizabeth, out of her special regard for him,
and her fear for his life or health, by her imperative command prevented
it.” “The good queen,” it is said, “who had particular tenderness for
‘handsome fellows,’ would not permit Sir John to run the hazard of the
trial.”</p>

<p>From this worthy member of a worthy family the popular tune of
“Pakington’s Pound,” or “Paggington’s Pound,” which has held its own
for three centuries, takes its origin. This tune, which in Queen Elizabeth’s
Virginal Book is named “Packington’s Pound,” is called by Ben Jonson
“Paggington’s Pound,” as also in an ancient MS. “A Fancy of Sir
John Paginton” appears in many of the early books of tunes, and numberless
ballads were written to it. Even Shakspere’s ballad (supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1175" id="Page_1175">[1175]</a></span>
have been written by him) on Sir Thomas Lucy is written to this tune. It
has been stated by some writers that, besides the tune of “Pakington’s
Pound,” that of “Sir Roger de Coverley” took its origin from this worthy;
but this is surely a mistake, as the latter tune takes its origin from one of
the Calverleys of Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Sir John Pakington married the daughter of Mr. Humphrey South,
Queen Elizabeth’s silkman, of Cheapside, London, the representative of an
ancient family in Leicestershire. She was the widow of Alderman Barnham,
“who left her very rich; and that consideration, together with her youth
and beauty, made it impossible for her to escape the addresses even of the
greatest persons about the court; but Sir John was the only happy man
who knew how to gain her, being recommended by his worthy friend,
Mr. William Seabright, town clerk of London, who had purchased the
manor of Besford, in Worcestershire.” This lady, by her first husband,
had four daughters; and by Sir John one son&mdash;John, his successor&mdash;and two
daughters: Anne, married, first, to Sir Humphrey Ferrars, Knt., of Tamworth,
and, secondly, to Philip, Earl of Chesterfield; and Mary, who married
Sir Robert Brooke, of Nacton, Master of the Ceremonies to James I. Sir
John died in 1625, aged seventy-seven, and his widow married, thirdly,
Lord Kilmurry; and, fourthly, Thomas, Earl of Kelly.</p>

<p>By this great Sir John Pakington the house at Westwood was erected.
“After he had finished his stately structure at Westwood,” it is recorded,
“Sir John invited the Earl of Northampton, Lord President, and his
countess to a housewarming; and as his lordship was a jovial companion,
a train of above one hundred knights and gentlemen accompanied him, who
staid for some time, and at their departure acknowledged they had met
with so kind a reception <i>that they did not know whether they had possessed the
place or the place them</i>. The delightful situation of his mansion was what
they had never before seen, the house standing in the middle of a wood cut
into twelve large ridings, and at a good distance one riding through all of
them: the whole surrounded by a park of six or seven miles, with, at the
further end facing the house, an artificial lake of one hundred and twenty-two
acres. His most splendid entertainment was given, however, to
James I. and his queen at Ailsbury, when his majesty honoured him with
a visit after his arrival from Scotland, before his coronation. Upon this
occasion he set no bounds to expense, thinking it a disparagement to be
outdone by any fellow-subject when such an opportunity offered; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1176" id="Page_1176">[1176]</a></span>
the king and court declared that they had never met with a more noble
reception.”</p>

<p>Lloyd, in his “Lives of the Statesmen and Favourites of England since
the Reformation,” thus speaks of Sir John Pakington:&mdash;“His handsome
features look the most, and his neat parts the wisest at court. He could
smile ladies to his service, and argue statesmen to his design with equal ease.
His reason was powerful, his beauty more. Never was a brave soul more
bravely seated; nature bestowed great parts on him, education polished
him to an admirable frame of prudence and virtue; Queen Elizabeth called
him her Temperance, and Leicester his Modesty. It is a question to this
day whether his resolution took the soldiers, his prudence the politicians,
his compliance the favourites, his complaisance the courtiers, his piety the
clergy, his integrity and condescension the people, or his knowledge the
learned, most. This new court star was a nine days’ wonder, engaging
all eyes until it set, satisfied with its own glory. He came to court, he
said, as Solomon did, to see its vanity, and retired, as he did, to repent it.
It was he who said first, what Bishop Sanderson urged afterwards, <i>that a
sound faith was the best divinity, a good conscience the best law, and temperance
the best physic</i>. Sir John Pakington in Queen Elizabeth’s time was virtuous
and modest, and Sir John Pakington in King Charles’s time loyal and
valiant; the one did well, the other suffered so. Greenham was his
favourite, Hammond his; the one had a competent estate and was contented,
the other hath a large one and is noble; this suppresseth factions
in the kingdom, the other composed them in the court, and was called by
courtiers Moderation. Westmorland tempted his fidelity, and Norfolk his
steadfastness, but he died in his bed an honest and a happy man.”</p>

<p>His son and heir, John Pakington, was created a baronet in 1620, as
Sir John Pakington of Ailsbury, where he resided. He married Frances,
daughter of Sir John Ferrars, of Tamworth (who married, as her second
husband, the Earl of Leven): by her he had issue one son, John, and two
daughters. John died at the early age of twenty-four, during the lifetime
of his father, and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his infant son, who
ultimately became possessed of the whole of his grandfather’s estates.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The North Front.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Sir John Pakington, the second baronet, who was only five years of age
when he succeeded, was placed under the guardianship of the Lord Keeper
Coventry, “by whose vigilant care of his education, both by travel and
other advantages, he became a most accomplished gentleman.” He was
elected M.P. for Worcestershire (15 Charles I.), and when the rebellion
broke out was member for Ailsbury; and, having on all occasions given
proofs of his fidelity to the Crown and the rights of the subject, was
intrusted by the King, in 1642, with a commission for arraying men for
his service in Worcestershire, on account of which he was taken prisoner,
committed to the Tower, and fined £5,000; had his estate sequestered, his
house in Buckinghamshire (one of the best in that county) levelled with the
ground, and such great waste committed in his woods, that an estimate of
the loss, still remaining, in the handwriting of his lady, amounts to
£20,348. His zeal in the loyal cause never swerved, for, notwithstanding
he had suffered so much for his loyalty, he had the courage to join King
Charles II. with a troop of horse at the battle of Worcester, and was taken
prisoner there, yet was so popular that, when afterwards tried for his life,
not one witness could be produced to swear against him. He was consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1178" id="Page_1178">[1178]</a></span>
acquitted and set at liberty, but afterwards fined £7,670, and
compelled, “for the said fine, to convey the market-house, the tolls, the
court leet, and certain grounds called Heyden Hill, parcel of the estate at
Ailsbury, to Thomas Scott (who was one of the king’s judges), and other
trustees, for the use of the town, which they kept until after the Restoration,
when, by a special act of parliament, the said conveyances were
made void.”</p>

<p>Sir John married Dorothy, daughter of his guardian, the Lord Keeper
Coventry, by whom he had issue one son, his successor, and two daughters.
This lady, Dorothy Pakington, was a woman of remarkable talent, and
possessed of every acquirement which a natural goodness of disposition and
the best tutorship could give. To her gifted mind it is, with all but
positive certainty, averred that the world is indebted for that admirable
book&mdash;about which almost as much controversy has been evoked as over
the “Letters of Junius”&mdash;“The Whole Duty of Man,” and for the several
other works by the same pen. The authorship of “The Whole Duty of
Man” has been variously ascribed to Lady Pakington, Archbishop Sancroft,
Archbishop Frewen, Archbishop Sterne, Bishop Fell, Bishop Chapel,
William Allestry, Abraham Woodhead, William Fulman, and others; but
the weight of probability, and certainly the weight of evidence, goes to
prove that that honour belongs to her ladyship. An almost incontrovertible
evidence of Lady Pakington being its authoress “arises from the
assertions of Archbishop Dolben, and Bishops Fell and Allestry, who are
said to have declared this of their own knowledge, after her death, which
she obliged them to keep private during her life&mdash;<i>that she really was the
author of that best and most masculine religious book extant in the English
language, ‘The Whole Duty of Man.’</i>” Upon a finely sculptured monument
in Hampton Lovett Church she and her husband are recorded in these
words:&mdash;“In the same church lyes Sir John Pakington, Kt. and Bart.,
and his lady, grandfather and grandmother to the said Sir John. The
first, try’d for his life and spent the greatest part of his fortune in adhering
to King Charles I.; and the latter justly reputed the authoress of the
Whole Duty of Man, who was exemplary for her great piety and goodness.”
Sir John died in 1680, and was succeeded by his son&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir John Pakington, who, having married Margaret, daughter of Sir
John Keys, died in 1688, and was in turn succeeded by his only child,
Sir John Pakington, the fourth baronet, who, when only nineteen years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1179" id="Page_1179">[1179]</a></span>
of age, became M.P. for Worcestershire, and so remained, with one
exception, when he voluntarily withdrew himself, to the time of his death.
He was “a strenuous asserter of the rights and liberties of the country,”
and in 1702 preferred that remarkable complaint against the Bishop of
Worcester and his son for unduly interfering in the elections, which
resulted in the Bishop being removed by the Queen from his office of
almoner, and other proceedings being taken. Sir John married, first,
Frances, daughter of Sir Henry Parker; and, secondly, Hester, daughter
and sole heiress of Sir Herbert Perrott. By his first marriage he had issue
two sons, who died young, and two daughters, one of whom married
Viscount Tracy. By his second wife, Hester Perrott, Sir John had a son,
Sir Herbert Perrott Pakington, by whom, on his death in 1727, he was
succeeded.</p>

<p>Sir Herbert Perrott Pakington, fifth baronet, M.P. for Worcestershire,
married, in 1721, Elizabeth, daughter of John Conyers, Esq., of Walthamstow,
and by her had issue two sons&mdash;John and Herbert Perrott, each of
whom enjoyed the baronetcy&mdash;and two daughters. Dying in 1748, he was
succeeded by his son&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir John Pakington, as sixth baronet, who married Mary, daughter of
Henry Bray, Esq., of Bromyard, but, dying in 1762 without issue, was
succeeded by his brother&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir Herbert Perrott Pakington, as seventh baronet. Sir Herbert married,
in 1759, Elizabeth, daughter of Cæsar Hawkins, Esq., and widow of
Herbert Wylde, Esq., of Ludlow, and by her had issue two sons and four
daughters&mdash;viz. John, his successor; Thomas, who died without issue;
Dorothy; Anne; Louisa; and Elizabeth, who married William Russell,
Esq., of Powick, Worcestershire, by which marriage she had an only son,
the present Lord Hampton, who, as will be shown, ultimately succeeded to
the estates. Sir Herbert Perrott Pakington died in 1795, and was succeeded,
as eighth and last baronet, by his son&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir John Pakington, D.C.L. This gentleman was born in 1760, and
died without issue, and unmarried, in 1830, when the title became extinct,
and the estates passed to his nephew, John Somerset Russell, Esq. (son of
his sister, Elizabeth Pakington, by her marriage with William Russell,
Esq., of Powick), who at once assumed the family name of Pakington in
lieu of that of Russell, and became John Somerset Pakington, Esq., and is
the present noble owner of Westwood.</p>

<p>The Right Hon. Lord Hampton&mdash;the first peer of the family&mdash;was born
in 1799, and, as we have stated, is the son of William Russell, Esq., by his
wife, Elizabeth Pakington. He succeeded, as John Somerset Russell, to
the estates of his uncle, Sir John Pakington, in 1830, and assumed the
patronymic of Pakington in lieu of his own name of Russell. He was
educated at Eton and at Oriel College, Oxford. In 1837 he was elected
M.P. for Droitwich, which town he continued to represent until 1874, when,
after nearly forty years of able, useful, and faithful public servitude, he
was defeated at the general election. In 1846 he was created a baronet, by
the name of Sir John Somerset Pakington, of Westwood Park. In 1852
Sir John held office as Secretary of State for the Colonies; in 1858-9 was a
member of the Committee of Council for Education; in 1858-9, and again
in 1866-7, was first Lord of the Admiralty; and in 1867-8 was Secretary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1181" id="Page_1181">[1181]</a></span>
State for War. In 1874 he was created Baron Hampton, of Hampton Lovett
and of Westwood, in the county of Worcester, in the peerage of the United
Kingdom. Lord Hampton, who is a Privy Councillor, a G.C.B., an Hon.
D.C.L. of Oxford, an Elder Brother of the Trinity House, a Magistrate, for
many years Chairman of the County Quarter Sessions, and Deputy Lieutenant
of the county, has married three times: first, in 1822, Mary (who
died in 1843), daughter of Moreton Aglionby Slaney, Esq., by whom he
has issue living one son, the Hon. John Slaney Pakington (heir to the title
and estates), who was born in 1826, and married, in 1849, the Lady Diana
Boyle, daughter of the Earl of Glasgow; secondly, in 1844, Augusta Anne
(who died in 1848), daughter of the Right Rev. George Murray, D.D.,
Bishop of Rochester, by whom he has issue living one son, the Hon. Herbert
Perrott Murray Pakington, born in 1848; thirdly, in 1851, Augusta, daughter
of Thomas Champion de Crespigny, Esq., and widow of Colonel Davis, M.P.,
of Elmley Park, Worcestershire, by whom he has no issue.</p>

<p>Lord Hampton is by no means entirely, or even mainly, indebted for
renown to the high positions he has occupied, although they are among the
very highest. There have been, of late years, few projects designed and
calculated to benefit mankind to which he has not been, in some way, a
contributor; foremost, indeed, he has always been in every good work that
may lessen suffering, extend social advantages, and advance the cause of
education and religion. The descendant and representative of a race that
has for centuries given to England true patriots, in the best sense of the

<p>The arms of Lord Hampton, who is patron of the living of Hampton
Lovett, are&mdash;per chevron, <i>sable</i> and <i>argent</i>; in chief three mullets, <i>or</i>, and
in base as many garbs, one and two, <i>gules</i>. Crest&mdash;an elephant, <i>or</i>. Supporters&mdash;dexter,
an elephant, <i>or</i>; sinister, a talbot, <i>argent</i>; each charged on
the shoulder with a mullet, pierced, <i>sable</i>. Motto&mdash;“Fidelis et audax.” His
seats are Westwood Park, Droitwich, and Powick Court, Worcester.</p>

<p>The pretty little Church of Hampton Lovett&mdash;one of the burial-places
of the family&mdash;lies about two miles from the mansion, from which it is
approached by a delightful drive across the park and the outlying portions
of the estate. The Church is charmingly situated, and possesses some
features of interest. It consists of a nave, chancel, and north aisle, with
a tower at the west end, and contains a modern stone pulpit of exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1182" id="Page_1182">[1182]</a></span>
design; and, besides recent stained-glass windows, there are some good
remains of ancient armorial stained glass, including the royal and Pakington
arms, &amp;c. In the chancel, which is paved with encaustic tiles, is a piscina
on the south side, and on the north a fine canopied tomb, on which has been
placed an explanatory brass plate, bearing the inscription, “This monument
was discovered behind another, which was removed to the west wall
of the side chapel, during the repair of the church in 1859. Though much
mutilated, the design was preserved, and the heraldic escutcheons (which
were uninjured) show it to have been erected to the memory of Sir John
Pakington, Kt., of Hampton Lovett, and Anne, his wife, daughter of Henry
Dacres, sometime Sheriff of London. He was eminent as a Lawyer and a
Judge, and amongst other honours received a grant of the lands of Westwood
from King Henry VIII.”</p>

<p>The monument here noted as being removed in 1859 stands against the
west wall of the north aisle, or “side chapel.” It is a fine piece of sculpture
in the style of Roubilliac, with a semi-recumbent figure of St. John. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1183" id="Page_1183">[1183]</a></span>
bears this highly interesting inscription:&mdash;“Here lyes Sir John Pakington,
Kt. and Bart., aged 55 years, an indulgent father to his children, a kind
master to his servants, charitable to the poor, loyal to the king, and faithful to
his country. Who served in many parliaments for the county of Worcester
speaking his mind there without reserve; neither fearing nor flattering
those in power, but despising all their offers of title and preferment upon
base and dishonourable terms of competition. He was chosen Recorder for
the City of Worcester the 21st day of February, 1725, in the room of Other,
Earl of Plymouth, deceased, which few ever enjoyed the honour of under
the degree of a Peer of the Realm. He dyed the 13th of Augt., 1727. In
the same church lyes Sir John Pakington, Kt. and Bart., and his lady,
grandfather and grandmother to the said Sir John. The fyrst try’d for his
life and spent the greatest part of his fortune in adhering to King Charles I.,
and the latter justly reputed the Authoress of The Whole Duty of Man,
who was exemplary for her great piety and goodness.” There is also a
tablet to Dorothy Anne, second daughter and co-heiress of Sir Herbert
Perrott Pakington, 1846; her father, 1785; her mother, Dame Elizabeth
Pakington, daughter of Sir Cæsar Hawkins, 1783; and Sir John Pakington,
1830; and one to the memory of Mary, the first wife of Lord Hampton,
and daughter of Moreton Aglionby Slaney, Esq., who was born in 1799
and died in 1843.</p>

<p>In the churchyard are some venerable yew-trees, and near the path is
a tall and lovely cross, of simple but effective design, restored by Lord
Hampton in memory of his second wife. At the head of the lofty shaft is a
crocketed cross bearing the sacred monogram: beneath this are beautifully
sculptured figures of the four evangelists under crocketed canopies. At the
base are the four evangelistic symbols, and beneath is the inscription,
“To the beloved memory of Augusta Anne, second wife of Sir John
Pakington, Bart., this cross was restored <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D. MDCCCXLIX.</span> She was the
daughter of George Murray, Lord Bishop of Rochester, and departed this
life in the true faith of Christ, February xxiii., <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCCXLVIII.</span>, after the birth
of her second child, and in the <span class="smcap lowercase">XXXIST</span> year of her age. + Not my will but
thine be done.”</p>

<p>We said, at the commencement of our notice, that Westwood Park lies
a couple of miles or so from Droitwich, and it therefore behoves us, before
closing, to say a word or two about that town, and the “healing waters”
which are its great attraction and blessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1184" id="Page_1184">[1184]</a></span></p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Westwood and Droitwich is very charming, the
walks and drives are beautiful, and the whole locality is rich in historic
lore and in antiquated traditions. Venerable church towers, pretty villages,
homely yet comfortable cottages, fruitful orchards, productive meadows and
corn lands, delicious lanes rich in wild flowers, wooded slopes, broad and
narrow rivers (notably, majestic Severn), are in view from any ascent.
But the eye takes in more than these: ancient mansions are numerous;
among them several of our justly boasted baronial halls. There are houses
of prosperous gentry, and picturesque dwellings of wood and plaster of a
long-ago time. Indeed, the rich and the poor may be equally content
with their lot in this fair, fertile, and rarely gifted locality. It is suggestive
of prosperity, and indicative of content, although the whistle of the railroad
is often heard, and the mysterious wires of the telegraph skirt the principal
highways. The distant views are even more graceful and majestic than
those near at hand. Grand old Malvern, the Abberley Hills, the Clees,
the “hunchbacked Wrekin,” the Clents, the Lickeys, Tardebigge, Astwood,
and even the far-off Cotswolds, may be seen from any of the neighbouring
heights.</p>

<p>Droitwich itself is a town devoid of beauty or interest, but it is situated
in a lovely district, with a glorious country around it, and a neighbourhood
rich in scenery and in picturesque localities. Internally the town is a
“land of many waters,” its brine wells, from which thousands of gallons
per hour are constantly being pumped up, producing an enormous quantity
of salt, which is sent out to supply the tables, and the workshops, and the
manufactories of our native population, as well as to help to render our
fields more prolific, and find employment for nearly the whole of its
population. Droitwich, there can be no doubt, is a town of Roman
foundation, and its salt-works were worked by that people on precisely the
same system of evaporation in vats as now. A portion of an interesting
Romano-British tesselated pavement&mdash;part of a Roman villa&mdash;was discovered
here some few years ago, and is preserved at Worcester. It is
indisputable evidence of Droitwich and its springs being known to the
Romans. Although small, and mainly depending for its prosperity on its
salt-works, Droitwich has always, since the Conquest, been a place of
importance, and until the passing of the Reform Bill sent two members
to Parliament; it now sends only one. It is governed by a mayor and
corporation, possesses abundance of schools and charitable institutions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1185" id="Page_1185">[1185]</a></span>
has spacious churches and other places of worship, and has every facility
of railway and canal communication.</p>

<p>The main feature of the place, however, is its recently re-established
Brine Baths. The efficacy of the saline springs was first brought into
notice of late years during the sad visitation of cholera to the town in 1831.
In that year, when numbers of the inhabitants were being carried off by
the pest, some parties, in their agonies of distress and their desire to find
means of saving the lives of those near and dear to them, dipped the
sufferers into the warm brine in the evaporating vats of the salt-works,
and this was found to produce such marvellous results that it was generally
adopted; indeed, it is affirmed that all who were so treated, even those in
a state of collapse, recovered from the attack. The fame of these cures
spread far and wide, and numbers being brought there for that and other
complaints, it was determined to form a bath. This was done, and the
efficacy of the brine firmly established. Later on a company was formed;
but although baths were erected, and patients were not wanting to visit
them, the whole matter fell into a state of unfortunate inanition, despite
the attention which had been directed to the place by Dr. Hastings and
other men of eminence. In 1871 Mr. Bainbrigge, F.R.C.S., a medical
man of enlarged experience and skill, visited the baths for the purpose
of examining, and analyzing, and reporting upon their properties and
efficacy. The result was, that a joint-stock company for the erection of
new baths, the opening up of the curative properties of the waters, and
the development of Droitwich into an inland sea-bathing place, was formed,
and baths were erected. These baths were opened in 1873, and since then
the whole affair has passed into the hands of a few private individuals.
The old George Hotel, with its pleasant garden (closely adjoining the bath),
has been converted into a private boarding-house, and about eight acres
of pleasure-grounds and gardens, with here and there a pleasant residence
attached, have been added and laid out with taste.</p>

<p>The visitor will find many objects of interest in Droitwich; and many
places of note&mdash;Whitely Court, the truly “Stately Home” of the Earl of
Dudley, being one of them&mdash;are within easy drive of the place.</p>

<p class="dc16">MELBOURNE HALL is interesting from the
curious and unique character of its gardens
rather than from the elegance or beauty of
the house; but it possesses in its historical
associations, and its connection with famous
families, a larger share of importance than
falls to the lot of many more pretentious
places. It is to the history of the “Home,”
and its charming and curious grounds, as well
as to the history of the noble families to which
it has belonged, that we purpose to direct
attention.</p>

<p>Melbourne itself&mdash;from which is derived
the title of Viscount Melbourne, as well as
the name of the thriving city of Melbourne,
in our far-distant dominion of Australia&mdash;is a
small manufacturing and market town in Derbyshire,
being situated on the borders of
Leicestershire, and lying in the charming
valley of the Trent. It is only eight miles from
Derby, from which place it is conveniently reached
by a branch railway; it is, therefore, now, since the
opening of this line, of easy access from that great
centre of railway traffic. The town contains some
goodly manufactories of silk and Lisle-thread gloves, figured lace, &amp;c., for
which it is much noted; and it is also well known for its productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1187" id="Page_1187">[1187]</a></span>
gardens and nurseries. It is but seven miles from famous Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
the scene of Sir Walter Scott’s undying “Ivanhoe,” and where the
splendid ruins of the grand old castle of the Zouches still stand in all their
beauty, and are among the most majestic and picturesque in the kingdom,
Kenilworth scarcely excepted. Melbourne is also within some few miles
of Calke Abbey, the elegant seat of Sir John Harpur Crewe, Bart.; and
not much farther from Donington Park, the seat of the late Marquis of
Hastings and the present Earl of Loudoun; Staunton Harold, the charming
residence of Earl Ferrers; and Elvaston Castle, the ancient seat of the
Earl of Harrington, whose gardens are much of the same character as those
we are about to describe. Indeed, the whole district, turn in whatever
direction one may, is full of interest and beauty.</p>

<p>At Melbourne, as stated in Domesday Book, King Edward VI. held
“six carucates of land for geld. Land for six ploughs. The King has one
plough there, and twenty villanes, and six bordars, having five ploughs.
A priest and a church there, and one mill of three shillings, and twenty-four
acres of meadow. Wood, pasturable, one mile in length and half a
mile in breadth. In the time of King Edward it was worth ten pounds;
now six pounds; yet it renders ten.” It was from very early times a
royal manor, and was granted by King John to Hugh de Beauchamp,
whose eldest son gave it in marriage with his daughter to William Fitz-Geoffrey,
but within a short period it again reverted to the Crown. By
Henry III. it was, in 1229, granted to Philip de Marc, from whom it again
passed into the sovereign’s hands. The manor and castle were afterwards
held by Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, brother to Edward I., and passed to
his son Thomas, by whom they were conveyed to King Edward II., who
granted them to Robert de Holland. This person was summoned to
Parliament as a baron, but having joined in the insurrection, he surrendered
himself at Derby, and was ultimately beheaded for high treason, and his
estates were confiscated. They were then held by Henry, Earl of Lancaster,
who had a grant of a market, &amp;c.; and they continued attached to the
earldom and duchy of Lancaster until 1604, when they were given by
King James to the Earl of Nottingham, who soon afterwards conveyed
them to the Earl of Huntingdon, from whom they passed to the Marquis
of Hastings.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry V. the country around the royal manor and
castle of Melbourne sent many warriors to the battle of Agincourt; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1188" id="Page_1188">[1188]</a></span>
although it may be a question whether the hills in the neighbourhood,
which are called “Derby Hills” to this day, or those in the Peak, at the
north end of the county, are intended in the ballad&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Recruit me Cheshire and Lancashire,</p>
<p class="pp7">And Derby Hills that are so free;</p>
<p class="pp6">No marry’d man or widow’s son:</p>
<p class="pp7">For no widow’s curse shall go with me.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“They recruited Cheshire and Lancashire,</p>
<p class="pp7">And Derby Hills that are so free;</p>
<p class="pp6">No marry’d man or widow’s son:</p>
<p class="pp7">Yet there was a jovial bold company”&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn1">certain it is that Derbyshire men were among the most valiant in that
battle, and that John, Duke of Bourbon, who was taken prisoner, was
brought to Melbourne Castle, and there kept in close confinement for nineteen
years. Melbourne Castle, now entirely destroyed, is traditionally said
to have been founded by Alfred the Great in 900. There appears, however,
to be no mention of it until 1307. In 1319 it passed into the hands of
Thomas de Holland, who obtained a license to crenellate the place in the
fourth year of Edward II. In 1322 “John de Hardshull was joined in
the governorship of the castles of Melbourne and Donington,” and a few
years later it became the property of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. In 1414.
as already stated, John, Duke of Bourbon, was prisoner here under Sir
Ralph Shirley, the governor of the castle, and afterwards under Nicholas
Montgomery, the then governor. It is said to have been dismantled by
order of Margaret, Queen of Henry VI. It was, it seems, repaired by
Edward IV., and in Henry VIII.’s reign is said to have been in “good
reparation.” In 1602 a survey was made, by order of Queen Elizabeth, by
Thomas Fanshawe, then auditor of the duchy of Lancaster, in which it is
said, “Her Majesty hath a faire and ancient castle which she keepeth in
her own hands, and that Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, was then constable
of the same and bailiffe there by letters patent during his life, with the
annual fee of £10.” It afterwards came into the hands of the Huntingdons,
and was suffered to fall into decay. The site now belongs to Mr.
Hastings.</p>

<p>Melbourne was formerly in the honour of Tutbury, its officers in that
honour being the “Steward of Melbourne,” the “Constable of Melbourne
Castle,” the “Keeper of Melbourne Park,” and the “Bayliffe of
Melbourne.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1189" id="Page_1189">[1189]</a></span></p>

<p>The Bishops of Carlisle had formerly a palace and a park at Melbourne,
and occasionally resided there, the palace being near the church, tolerably
close to the castle, and on the site of what is now Melbourne Hall.
After being long held on lease from the see, it ultimately became the
property of the Coke family. An arch, in the early English style, conjectured
to have belonged to the old nunnery near the church, was taken
down about 1821.</p>

<p>The Cokes, to whom Melbourne Castle and Hall belonged, are an old
Derbyshire family, whose estates lay principally at Trusley, Marchington,
Thurvaston, Pinxton, Egginton, and other places, The head of the family,
in the forty-third year of the reign of Edward III., was Hugh Coke, son
of Robert Coke. His eldest son, Thomas, married Elizabeth, daughter and
co-heiress of Thomas Odingsells. By this lady, who brought the Trusley
estates into the family, he had issue a son, William
Coke, who, marrying Joan, daughter of John Hilton,
by her had issue a son, William Coke, who, by his
first wife, Cicely Brentwood, had a son, also William
Coke, by whom he was succeeded. This William Coke
married a daughter of Sir Ralph Longford, by whom
he had issue his son and successor, William Coke,
who, marrying Dorothy, daughter of Ralph Fitzherbert,
of Tissington, had issue two sons&mdash;John and
Richard&mdash;and six daughters, viz. Elizabeth, Dorothy,
Margaret, Anne, Ellen, and Mabel. He was succeeded by his son, Richard
Coke, who married Mary, daughter and sole heiress to Thomas Sacheverell,
by whom he acquired considerable property. By this marriage
Richard Coke had issue six sons&mdash;viz. Sir Francis Coke, of Trusley, Knt.;
Sir John Coke, Secretary of State; Thomas Coke; Philip Coke; George
Coke, Bishop of Hereford and Bristol; and Robert Coke&mdash;and four
daughters, viz. Elizabeth, Mary, Margaret, and Dorothy.</p>

<p>Sir John Coke, the first of the family who settled at Melbourne,
was born in 1563, and greatly distinguished himself by his learning. He
was successively Professor of Rhetoric at Cambridge, Secretary of the
Navy, Master of the Court of Requests, Secretary of State to King
Charles I., and for several years a member of Parliament, where he took
an active and dignified part in the debates. Sir John, who died in 1644,
was married twice: first, to Mary, daughter of John Powell, of Presteign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1190" id="Page_1190">[1190]</a></span>
by whom he had issue; and, secondly, to Joan, daughter of Alderman Sir
John Lee, Knt., and widow of Alderman Gore. He was succeeded by
his son (by his first wife), Thomas Coke, whose son (by his wife Mary,
daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Pope, of Wolferston), John Coke, married Mary, daughter
of Sir Thomas Leventhorpe, by whom, with other issue, he had three
sons, one of whom, the Right Hon. Thomas Coke, became Vice-Chamberlain
to Queen Anne and King George I., and served in Parliament for
many years. This gentleman was so great a favourite with his sovereign,
Queen Anne, that she presented to him, among other marks of royal
favour, the two splendid vases now placed in the grounds of Melbourne
Hall. By his first wife, Mary, daughter of Philip, Earl of Chesterfield,
he had issue two daughters&mdash;Mary, married to Viscount Southwell, and
Elizabeth, married to Bache Thornhill, Esq.; and by his second wife, the
Hon. Mary Hale, sister of Bernard Hale, Esq., one of the maids of
honour to Queen Anne, he had issue, with others, a daughter, Charlotte,
who became his sole heiress on the death of her brother, George Lewis
Coke.</p>

<p>This Charlotte Coke married, in 1740, Sir Matthew Lamb, Bart., of
Brockett Hall, Hertfordshire, nephew and co-heir of Peniston Lamb, Esq.,
and was the mother, by him, of Sir Peniston Lamb, Bart., who was created
Baron Melbourne, Baron Kilmore, and Viscount Melbourne of Melbourne.
His wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, by whom he had
four sons and three daughters&mdash;viz. the Hon. Peniston Lamb, who died
unmarried; the Hon. William Lamb, who succeeded him; the Hon. Frederick
James Lamb, who also succeeded to the titles and estates; the Hon.
George Lamb, M.P. (well known for his literary attainments), who married
Mdlle. Caroline Rosalie St. Jules; the Hon. Emily Mary Lamb, married, first,
to Earl Cowper, and, secondly, to Viscount Palmerston; the Hon. Harriette
Lamb; and a daughter who died in infancy. Lord Melbourne, who died in
1828, was succeeded in his titles and estates, as second viscount, by his
second son, William, who, after holding many important posts, and taking
an active part in the administration of this country, became Prime Minister.
He was born in 1779, and educated at Eton, Cambridge, and Glasgow, and in
1804 was called to the bar. In 1805 he entered Parliament, and in the same
year married Lady Caroline Ponsonby, daughter of the Earl of Bessborough,
a lady who became, as “Lady Caroline Lamb,” distinguished in the literary
circles of the day.</p>

<p>In 1818 Mr. Lamb became Secretary for Ireland under
Canning, and so continued under the next two administrations. In 1828 he
succeeded to the titles and estates as second Viscount Melbourne, Baron
Melbourne, and Baron Kilmore. In 1830 his lordship became Home
Secretary, and in July, 1834, was made Prime Minister, but only retained
that office till the following November. In 1835 he again became Prime
Minister, and so continued until 1841. Being Premier at the time of the
Queen’s accession to the throne, Lord Melbourne became her Majesty’s
confidential adviser. His lordship died, in 1848, without surviving issue,
when the title passed to his brother, the Hon. Frederick Lamb, who had
been, in 1839, created Baron Beauvale, and had held many important posts.
His lordship, who married the Countess Adela, daughter of Count Maltzan,
Prussian Ambassador at Vienna, died without issue, when the title became
extinct. The estates then passed to his only surviving sister, the Hon.
Emily Mary, married, first, to Earl Cowper, and, secondly, to the late Prime
Minister, Viscount Palmerston. This lady was born in 1787, and married,
in 1805, Peter Leopold Louis Francis, fifth Earl Cowper, by whom she had
issue&mdash;George Augustus Frederick, Viscount Fordwich, who became sixth
Earl Cowper; Lady Emily Caroline Catherine, married, in 1830, to the
present Earl of Shaftesbury; the Hon. William Francis Cowper, who, on
the death of Lady Palmerston, in 1869, became the owner, under his will, of
Lord Palmerston’s estates, and assumed the additional surname of Temple
(Cowper-Temple); the Hon. Charles Spencer Cowper, who married the
Lady Blessington, and afterwards Jessie Mary, only surviving child of
Colonel Clinton McLean; and the Lady Frances Elizabeth. Earl Cowper
dying in 1837, Lady Cowper, in 1839, was married to Viscount Palmerston,
who, dying in 1865, left her again a widow, and his title became extinct.
At Lady Palmerston’s death, in 1869, her estates passed to her grandson,
the present Earl Cowper, who now owns Melbourne Hall and its surrounding
estates.</p>

<p>The Hon. Henry John Temple, third Viscount Palmerston and Baron
Temple of Mount Temple, was the son of Henry, second Viscount Palmerston,
by his second wife, Mary, daughter of Benjamin Mee, of Bath.
He was born in 1784, and was educated at Harrow and at St. John’s
College, Cambridge, and succeeded his father in the titles and estates as
third Viscount Palmerston and Baron Temple in 1802, and entered Parliament
in 1807, from which time his name was intimately mixed up with the
political history of this country. He successively became a Knight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1193" id="Page_1193">[1193]</a></span>
Garter and a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath, and, among other offices,
Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, Constable of Dover Castle, Elder Brother
of Trinity House, Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow, a Lord of the
Admiralty, Secretary at War, Foreign Secretary, and Home Secretary. In
1855 he became Prime Minister, and so continued until 1858. In 1859 he
again became Prime Minister, and died whilst holding that office in 1865.
The title then became extinct. Lord Palmerston by his will, dated
November 22nd, 1864, left his real and leasehold estates in England and
Ireland to Lady Palmerston for life, and after her decease to her second son,
the Right Hon. William Francis Cowper. The will expressed an earnest
wish that Mr. Cowper, upon coming into possession of the estates, should
immediately apply for a royal license to take and use, for himself and his
descendants, the surname of Temple, either in substitution for, or in addition
to, that of Cowper, but so that Temple should be the final name; and the
family arms of Temple to be quartered with those of Cowper. This was
accordingly done. The arms of Lord Palmerston were&mdash;quarterly, first and
fourth, <i>or</i>, an eagle displayed, <i>sable</i>; second and third, <i>argent</i>, two bars, <i>sable</i>,
each charged with three martlets, <i>or</i>. Supporters&mdash;dexter, a lion reguardant,
<i>pæan</i>; and sinister, a horse reguardant, <i>argent</i>, maned, tailed, and hoofed,
<i>or</i>. Crest&mdash;a hound sejant, <i>sable</i>, collared, <i>or</i>. Motto&mdash;“Flecti non frangi.”</p>

<p>It is a somewhat curious circumstance, as will have been gleaned, and
one worth noting, that Melbourne Hall became the seat, within twenty
years, of two Prime Ministers, and that the titles of each, Lords Melbourne
and Palmerston, have become extinct.</p>

<p>The present noble owner of Melbourne Hall and its surrounding estates is
the Right Hon. Francis Thomas De Grey Cowper, seventh Earl Cowper,
Viscount Fordwich, Baron Cowper, Baron Butler, and Baron Dingwall, and a
Baronet. His lordship (who is grandson of Lady Palmerston) was born in
1834, and is the son of George Augustus Frederick, sixth earl, by his wife,
Anne Florence, Baroness Lucas, daughter of the second Earl De Grey, and
was educated at Harrow and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he proceeded
M.A. in 1855. He succeeded to the titles and estates on the death of his
father in 1856, and from 1871 to 1874 was Captain and Gold Shell of H.M.
Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms. In 1870 Earl Cowper married Katrine Cecilia,
daughter of Lord William Compton, heir-presumptive to the Marquis of
Northampton, by whom, however, he has no issue, the heir-presumptive
being his brother, the Hon. Henry Frederick Cowper, M.P.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Gardens and Yew Tunnel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Gardens and Grounds of Melbourne Hall are its chief attractions
They are a curious and elegant relic of the old style of horticulture, which
was brought from Holland by William III., consisting of groves, fountains,
statues, &amp;c., and are of the most strikingly peculiar character. In one place,
on entering, the visitor finds himself in the Lover’s Walk, a literal tunnel
(the outside, of which is shown in our view of the grounds) formed of very
aged yew-trees, arched and netted and intergrown one with another, only
here and there pierced by rays of light. In another he finds himself by the
side of a basin, in the centre of which a fountain is ever playing; while in
its clear waters magnificent carp are lazily swimming or basking in the sun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1195" id="Page_1195">[1195]</a></span>
In another place he comes upon a “cool grot”&mdash;a mineral spring, over
which is erected a charming rustic grotto of spars, shells, stalactites, and
other natural objects, and bearing on a marble tablet lines by the Hon.
George Lamb:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Rest, weary stranger, in this shady cave,<br />
And taste, if languid, of the mineral wave;<br />
There’s virtue in the draught; for health that flies<br />
From crowded cities and their smoky skies,<br />
Here lends her power from every glade and hill,<br />
Strength to the breeze, and medicine to the rill.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Gardens, as seen from the Hall.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The lawn in front of the mansion is laid out in ornamental beds, filled
with the choicest flowers, and dotted over with groups, single figures,
vases, &amp;c., of fine sculpture, of which it may be interesting to note that the
pair of black figures only cost, about the year 1630, £30, and the Perseus
and Andromeda £45. At the opposite side of the grounds from the
house is an alcove of elaborate design in wrought-iron, bearing the arms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1196" id="Page_1196">[1196]</a></span>of Coke, which, with the central basin and fountain, is shown in our
engraving of the gardens as seen from the hall. The Scotch firs which
form the background of the gardens were planted in the time of
William III., the trunks being, in many instances, 80 feet in height, and
13 or 14 feet in circumference. One of these Scotch firs, which fell in the
spring of 1875, was known to be one hundred and seventy-six years old;
its dimensions were extraordinary. They were as follows:&mdash;Height,
82 feet; length of butt, 39 feet; circumference at eight feet from the
ground, 10 feet 8 inches; circumference at thirty-nine feet from the
ground, 9 feet 2 inches; total contents of timber, 340 cubic feet. Leading
in a south-easterly direction from the parterred lawn, the gardens become
entirely changed in character, and the visitor wanders through sylvan
walks, bounded on either side by impenetrable yew hedges, which intersect
each other in every direction, at every turn coming upon a fine piece
of sculpture, or rippling stream, or bubbling fountain.</p>

<p>One of the walks leads to a gentle eminence at the junction of three
splendid glades, with gigantic lime hedges, in the centre of which is
placed the enormous bronzed vase of lead&mdash;one of the finest pieces of
modelling in existence&mdash;called the “Seasons,” which, with another
exquisite, though plainer, vase placed almost in close contiguity, was
presented by Queen Anne to her Vice-Chamberlain, Thomas Coke. On
the pedestals is the monogram, “T. C.,” of the Thomas Coke to whom
they were given. On occasion of its being repaired, in 1840, the following
inscription, written by Mr. H. Fox, was placed in its interior:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">The Terrace Walk, formed so as to overlook the magnificent lake, is a
pleasant and favourite promenade for visitors, and commands some charming
views of the grounds, the lake, the church, and neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1197" id="Page_1197">[1197]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lake, or Pool, as it is commonly called, is nearly twenty-two acres
in extent, and is beautifully wooded on its banks, and, with its island,
the swans which are always sailing on its surface, and the pleasure-boats
frequently gliding about, forms a beautiful picture from whatever point
it is viewed. The gardens, it may be added, cover an extent of nearly
twenty acres of ground; and it is worth noting that on the wall near the
Conservatory and the Muniment-room is the finest and largest <i>Wistaria</i> in
existence&mdash;its extent along the wall being no less than two hundred and
sixty-four feet.</p>

<p>In the hall itself is a splendid collection of pictures, including many
very rare examples&mdash;family portraits, principally of the old celebrities of
the Coke family and others. In this house Baxter wrote his “Saint’s
Rest;” and here many distinguished men have at one time or other
resided. Of this Baxter himself thus wrote:&mdash;“The second book which I
wrote (and the first which I began) was that called ‘Saint’s Everlasting
Rest.’ While I was in health I had not the least thoughts of writing books,
or in serving God in any more public way than that of preaching; but when
I was weakened with much bleeding, and left solitary in my chamber at Sir
John Coke’s in Derbyshire, without any acquaintance but my servant about
me, and was sentenced to death by my physicians, I began to contemplate
more seriously the <i>Everlasting Rest</i> which I apprehended myself just on the
borders of; and that my thoughts might not be scattered too much in
my meditation, I began to write something upon that subject, intending
but a sermon or two (which is the cause that the beginning is in brevity
and style disproportionable to the rest); but being continued long in
sickness, where I had no poor or better employment, I followed it on till
it was enlarged to the bulk in which it is now published.” The hall was at
one time, about 1811, occupied by Sir Sidney Smith, the “Hero of Acre,”
and also by Sir William Rumbold: it was likewise for many years in
the occupation of Colonel Gooch, one of the heroes of Waterloo&mdash;in fact,
one of the seven brave men immortalised in history as having defended the
important and critical post of Houguemont in that great battle. It is
now occupied by William Dashwood Fane, Esq.</p>

<p>Closely adjoining the hall is Melbourne Church, which is, without
doubt, one of the very finest and most perfect Norman structures remaining
to us, reminding one forcibly, in its massive piers and other features, of
Durham Cathedral. Indeed, it is far more of a cathedral in appearance than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1198" id="Page_1198">[1198]</a></span>
a parish church. The western doorway is one of its most striking external
features; but internally it is full of interest in every part. It is a cruciform
structure, with massive central tower, and two other lantern towers at its west
end. The nave is divided from the side-aisles by a series of massive round
piers supporting semicircular arches, above which is a fine open triforium
running entirely round the nave. Remains of a circular apse are to be
traced at the east end. Its monuments, too, are worthy of careful examination;
they are mainly to the family of Hardinge, of King’s Newton, the
head of which family is the present Lord Hardinge.</p>

<p>One mile from Melbourne is the pleasant village of King’s Newton, with
its Holy Well and its Hall, now in ruins, but long the paternal residence of
the Hardinge family, and from which its then representative, Viscount Hardinge,
of King’s Newton&mdash;the heroic Governor-General of India&mdash;took his
title. This distinguished family had been settled at this place for several
centuries, the hall being built by them <i>circa</i> 1400. Sir Robert Hardinge,
who was Master of the Court of Chancery and Attorney-General to Charles II.,
resided here, and was visited by that monarch, who remained his guest for
some days. On the glass of the window of his room King Charles scratched
the anagram, <i>Cras ero lux</i>, being a clever transposition of the words, <i>Carolus
rex</i>, and meaning “To-morrow I shall shine.” In the garden is a famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1199" id="Page_1199">[1199]</a></span>
old mulberry-tree, under which it is said the monarch used to sit: it is still
luxuriant in foliage and in fruit. The hall was destroyed by fire only a
few years ago, and its picturesque ruins and grounds are now open to the
public, who during the summer months “there do congregate” for pic-nic
parties and rural enjoyments. Our engraving shows the hall as it appeared
before the fire.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>King’s Newton Hall as it was.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The village of King’s Newton, one of the most delightful of villages,
has a literary celebrity attaching to it. Here Thomas Hall, who wrote
“Wisdom’s Conquest” in 1640, resided; and here, too, Speechly,
the Rural Economist; Mundy, who wrote “The Fall of Needwood” and
“Needwood Forest;” Mrs. Green, the authoress of “John Gray of Willoughby;”
the Ortons, one of whom is known by his “Excelsior” and his
“Three Palaces,” and the other by his varied writings, were residents, as
was also the author of “Thurstan Meverell;” and here, in his native place,
resided till his death, in February, 1876, the able historian of Melbourne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1200" id="Page_1200">[1200]</a></span>
Mr. John Joseph Briggs, who also ranked high as a writer on natural
history. The locality has other attractions “too numerous to mention.”
Independently of its great natural beauties, its most attractive associations
are undoubtedly with a grand and honourable past. Of King’s Newton
Mr. Briggs thus wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Sweet Newton, first to thee my song I raise.<br />
Thy charms, loved hamlet, need no poet’s praise;<br />
O’er thy green meads first trips the laughing Spring,<br />
And shakes primroses from each flower-wreathed wing:<br />
There the first swallow skims the daisied vale,<br />
And the loved cuckoo breathes her mellow tale,<br />
And merry chiff-chaff from the budding tree<br />
Gives out his joyous notes so wild and free.<br />
And when old Autumn sheds o’er field and bower<br />
The radiant hues of many a gorgeous flower,<br />
And bids the sun lead down his stately dance,<br />
Thy fields are last to catch his parting glance.<br />
Within thy bounds I drew mine earliest breath,<br />
And there, grant Heaven, these eyes may close in death!”</p>

<p>Besides its ruined hall, there is at King’s Newton a Holy Well, the
structure over which was erected by Robert Hardinge in 1660, and restored
a few years back by one of his descendants. It bears on its front the
inscription&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Fons sacer hic strvitvr Roberto nominis Hardinge</span>, 1660.”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Just rising from fair fields clad now in green,<br />
Its beauteous church-spire tap’ring o’er the wood,”</p>

<p class="pn1">on the banks of “silver Trent,” is one of the most favourite and famous
fishing resorts of the district, and its manifold attractions have often been
the theme of the local poet’s song:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Sweet Weston Cliff! how beautiful art thou!<br />
How dark the firs that crown thy rugged brow!<br />
Adown thy sides the straggling white sloe falls,<br />
And blossom’d thorns outspread their snowy palls,<br />
And the glad furze hath beauteously unrolled<br />
For the Spring’s feet her gorgeous cloth of gold.”</p>

<p class="p1">Donington Cliff, too, on the river margin of the broad lands of Donington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1202" id="Page_1202">[1202]</a></span>
the seat of the late Marquis of Hastings and of Mr. Hastings, father of
the present Earl of Loudoun, is a charming spot, especially where, as
shown in our engraving,</p>

<p class="dc13">SOMERLEYTON, the Sumerledetun of Domesday survey,
and occasionally in later times written Somerley, lies
about six miles from Lowestoft, in the county of Suffolk,
its nearest point on the coast being some four miles
distant. At the time of the Conquest, Wihtred, a
free man and a priest, held forty acres for a manor,
and Ulf, a free man under the protection of Earl
Gurth, held two carucates of land for a manor.
The whole place was seized by the Conqueror, and
given to Roger Bigod as steward. It was soon after held as one
manor by Sir Peter Fitz-Osbert, whose son, Sir Roger Fitz-Osbert,
was lord of the place, <i>temp.</i> Henry III., and was, 22nd Edward I.
summoned to Parliament as Baron Osborne: he died in 1305-6.
His sister, Isabel Fitz-Osbert, wife of Sir Walter Jernegan, or Jerningham,
of Horham Jernegan, in Suffolk, and widow of Sir Henry de
Walpole, became heiress to the Somerleyton estates on the death of her
brother, and thus they passed into the Jernegan family.</p>

<p>The Jernegans, even at that time, boasted an ancient pedigree. The
earliest of whom there is any record was living in 1182, and left by his
wife Sibilla a son, Hubert, who, in 1203, married Margery, daughter and
heiress of De Harling, of East Harling, and by her had issue, besides
others, a son, Sir Hugh Jernegan, who married Ellen, daughter and heiress
of Sir Thomas Englethorpe. Their son it was who married Isabel Fitz-Osbert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1204" id="Page_1204">[1204]</a></span>
and thus acquired the manor of Somerleyton in her right. Their
son, Sir Peter Jernegan, Knt., married three wives: first, Alice, daughter of
Sir Hugh Germayne; secondly, Matilda, daughter of Sir Roger Herling; and
thirdly, Ellen, daughter of Sir Roger de Huntingfield. By his first wife he
had issue Sir John Jernegan, Knt., of Somerleyton, whose wife was Agatha,
daughter of Sir Robert Shelton, of Shelton, Knt. Their son, Sir John
Jernegan, who died in 1375, married Joan, daughter and co-heiress of Sir
William de Kelveden and widow of Sir John Lowdham, by whom he had
issue his son and successor, Sir John Jernegan, who, by his wife Margaret,
daughter of Sir Thomas Vise de Lou, Knt., of Shotley, had, besides other
issue, a son, Sir Thomas Jernegan, Knt., who succeeded him, and who
married Joan Appleyard, of Dunston, by whom he left a son, John
Jernegan, who succeeded him. This gentleman married twice: by his first
wife, Jane, daughter of Sir John Darell, of Calehill, he had a son and heir,
John Jernegan, who married Isabel, daughter and heiress of Sir Gervase
Clifton, Knt. The issue of this marriage was a son, Sir Edward Jernegan,
who was knighted, and succeeded his father in the estates.</p>

<p>This Sir Edward Jernegan was married twice: first, to Margaret,
daughter of Sir Edmund Bedingfield, Knt.; and, secondly, to Mary,
daughter and co-heiress of Richard Scroope, son of Lord Scroope. By this
second marriage he had, among other issue, a son, Sir Henry Jerningham,
of Wingfield and Huntingfield Hall, in Suffolk, and of Coney, in Norfolk,
Vice-Chamberlain and Master of the Horse to Queen Mary, from whom are
descended the present Jerninghams of Staffordshire and other counties. By
his first wife Sir Edward had issue six sons&mdash;Sir John, Sir Robert, Thomas,
Olyf, Nicholas, and Edward&mdash;and two daughters: Ann, who became the wife
of five husbands, and Margaret, who was twice married. He died in 1515,
and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir John Jernegan, of Somerleyton,
who married Bridget, daughter of Sir Robert Drury, Knt., of Halsted, by
whom, with other issue, he had a son, George Jernegan, who succeeded
him, and who, having espoused Elye, daughter of Sir John Spelman, of
Narborough, Knt., was succeeded by his son, John Jernegan. This gentleman
married Catherine, daughter of George Brooke, Lord Cobham, and
had by her issue four daughters, his co-heiresses&mdash;viz. Elizabeth;
Katherine, married to Wymond Carew; Frances, married, first, to Thomas
Bedingfield, and, secondly, to her relative Henry Jerningham, of Coney Park;
and Margaret, married to &mdash;&mdash; Ford, of Butley. Frances, the third daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1205" id="Page_1205">[1205]</a></span>
inherited Somerleyton, and conveyed it to her second husband, Henry
Jerningham, who sold it to John Wentworth, Esq.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The South Lodge.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It will thus have been seen that the Jernegans (whose arms were&mdash;<i>argent</i>,
three buckles, <i>gules</i>) held Somerleyton for no fewer than thirteen generations.
In addition to this, they became possessed of the greater part of the King’s
manor of the Island of Lothingland&mdash;a district occupying the north-east
corner of the county of Suffolk, and containing the sixteen parishes of
Somerleyton, Lowestoft, Corton, Gunton, Oulton, Ashby, Lound, Fritton,
Flixton, Hopton, Blundeston, Gorleston, Belton, Burgh, Bradwell, and
Herringfleet. In 1619 Henry Jerningham died at Cossey, nine years after
having sold Somerleyton to John Wentworth, whose son was Sir John
Wentworth, one of the chiefs of the Cavalier party of the district during the
civil wars; and Cromwell and his troopers paid several visits to the old
hall, making free with its forage, and “carrying away its musquets.” The
village of Somerleyton appears, like its master, to have been staunchly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1206" id="Page_1206">[1206]</a></span>
loyal, and was harassed in consequence by the quartering of soldiers and
the exaction of forced loans by the partisans of the Commonwealth. Ireton,
in 1648, summoned the bailiffs of Yarmouth to meet him in conference at
Somerleyton Hall, and there delivered to them the Lord General’s peremptory
command, either to “ingarrison their town, or to demolish their walls
and fortifications.” A rousing bonfire and bountiful distribution of bread
and beer celebrated the restoration of King Charles II.</p>

<p>Sir John Wentworth records that “on the 14th day of March, 1642,
Collonell Cromwell’s troope, and Captain Fountayne with his troope, and
divers others, to the number of 140, came to Somerley Hall;” the day after
they “tooke away muskets, bandeliers, rests, head-pieces, and one fowling-piece,”
and other things of which no note was made. The Protector was,
therefore, certainly an inmate of Somerleyton, and probably more than once.
Matters changed, however: in 1660 an order was issued to the constables
of Somerleyton and Ashby “to re-provide prayer books for their churches;”
also to warn “all alehouse-keepers and butchers to enter recognisance for the
observation of Lent and fish dayes.” The stout old knight did not live to
see the King “enjoy his own again;” but his loyal widow did, and subscribed
ten shillings “towards the building of a bone fire” upon St.
George’s Day, 1661.</p>

<p>Sir John Wentworth married Anne Soame, but died without issue in
1651. From the Wentworths, Somerleyton passed to John Garneys, the son
of Elizabeth Wentworth, sister of Sir Thomas Wentworth, who had become
the wife of Charles Garneys, a member of the fine old Suffolk family who
bore the alliterative motto of “God’s Grace Guides Garneys.” The Garneys
(whose arms were&mdash;<i>argent</i>, a chevron engrailed, <i>azure</i>, between three escallop
shells, <i>sable</i>) were originally seated at Boyland Hall, Morningthorpe,
Norfolk, and at Heveringham and Kenton, in Suffolk. In 1672 the then
representative of the family, Thomas Garneys, sold the estate to Admiral
Sir Thomas Allin, Bart., a Suffolk worthy whose name figures prominently
in history. Thomas Garneys then removed from Somerleyton to Boyland
Hall, where he had a son, Wentworth Garneys, who married Mary,
daughter of Sir Thomas Abdy. Sir Thomas Allin was born in 1613, and
was captain of one of the ships in the service of the Commonwealth which
went over to the Prince of Wales. In 1663 he was constituted commander-in-chief
in the Downs, and later on of the Mediterranean. In 1665 he struck
the first blow of war with the Dutch by attacking their Smyrna fleet of forty
ships with eight sail of the line, when, after making prizes of four ships, he
drove the remaining thirty-six into Cadiz harbour. In the same year, in
the great sea-fight off Lowestoft, when the English fleet, under the Duke
of York, Prince Rupert, and others, engaged the Dutch fleet under Van
Tromp, Admiral Allin held a command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1207" id="Page_1207">[1207]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Front.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the following year Allin was
at the head of the White Squadron when the fleet fell upon the Dutch van,
routing it and killing the three Dutch admirals who commanded that
division. In the same year Allin attacked the French fleet, boarding and
capturing the <i>Ruby</i> of fifty-four guns. Three years later “he sailed with a
strong squadron to chastise the Algerines,” which he accomplished, and
returned home worn out in the heavy services of his country. In consideration
of these many services Admiral Allin was created a baronet in 1673,
and retired to Somerleyton, which, as has been stated, he had recently purchased.
A portrait of the brave old admiral, who was called “the Scourge of
Yarmouth,” is now at Somerleyton. That town took the side of the Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1208" id="Page_1208">[1208]</a></span>
in the civil war, while Lowestoft was profoundly loyal. Sir Thomas
married, first, Alice, daughter of Captain Whiting, of Lowestoft, by whom
he had issue one son&mdash;Thomas Allin, his successor&mdash;and two daughters:
Anne, who died unmarried, and Alice, married to Edmund Anguish, Esq., of
Moulton, in the county of Norfolk, whose son inherited the estates and title;
and, secondly, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Anguish, Esq., and sister of
his son-in-law, by whom he had no issue. Sir Thomas died in 1686 or 1688,
and was buried at Somerleyton. He was succeeded by his son, Sir Thomas
Allin, who married Mary, daughter of John Caldwall, of London; but,
dying without issue in 1696, the baronetcy became extinct, and the estates
devolved upon his nephew, Richard Anguish, Esq., son of Alice Allin and
her husband, Edmund Anguish, Esq. The arms of Allin were&mdash;<i>gules</i>, three

<p>This Alice Allin had issue by her husband, Edmund Anguish, three
sons&mdash;Richard, Edmund, and Allin&mdash;the eldest of whom, Richard, inherited
Somerleyton, and having, in accordance with the will of his uncle, assumed
the arms and surname of Allin, was created a baronet in 1699: the
descendants of Edmund, the second son, afterwards inherited the estates.
Sir Richard Allin (formerly Anguish) married Frances, only daughter of
Sir Henry Ashurst, Bart., of Waterstock, by whom he had issue four sons&mdash;Thomas
Allin, Henry Allin, Richard Allin, and the Rev. Ashurst Allin&mdash;and
one daughter, Diana, married to Thomas Henry Ashurst, Esq., of Waterstock.
Sir Richard died in 1725, and was succeeded in his title and estates
by his eldest son, Sir Thomas Allin, Bart., who, dying unmarried in 1764,
was succeeded by his brother, the Rev. Sir Ashurst Allin, Bart., Rector
of Blundeston-cum-Flixton, who married Thomasin Norris, and, dying
in 1770, was succeeded by his only son, Sir Thomas Allin, Bart. This
gentleman died unmarried in 1794, when the baronetcy again became
extinct, the Somerleyton estates passing to his distant kinsman, Thomas
Anguish, Esq., as will now be shown.</p>

<p>Edmund Anguish, second son of Alice Allin, and her husband, Edmund
Anguish, married Mary Betts, by whom he had issue two sons&mdash;the
Rev. Thomas and Edmund&mdash;and two daughters, Mary and Dorothy. The
Rev. Thomas Anguish, who was of Halesworth, married Mary Eling, of
Beccles, and, dying in 1763, was succeeded by his son, Thomas Anguish,
Accountant-General to the Court of Chancery; who, marrying Sarah Henley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1209" id="Page_1209">[1209]</a></span>
of Docking, had issue by her three sons&mdash;Thomas, the Rev. George, and
Charles&mdash;and three daughters, Catherine, Anne, and Charlotte. The eldest
of the sons, Thomas Anguish, it was who inherited the estates of Somerleyton
on the death of his kinsman, Sir Thomas Allin, Bart., when the title became
extinct. This Thomas Anguish died unmarried in 1810, and was succeeded
by his brother, the Rev. George Anguish, from whom, in 1843 (when the
line became extinct), the estates passed to the son of his sister, Catherine
Anguish, who, in 1788, had married Francis Godolphin-Osborne, fifth
Duke of Leeds, she being his second wife. By this union she had issue
Lord Sidney Godolphin-Osborne and Lady Anne Sarah Godolphin, married
to John Whyte-Melville, Esq. Their son, Captain Whyte-Melville, is the
distinguished author of many works of fiction. The arms of Anguish
were&mdash;<i>gules</i>, a cinquefoil, pierced, <i>or</i>; the crest&mdash;a snake coiled, encircled
with grass; and the motto&mdash;“Latet anguis in herbâ.”</p>

<p>The Somerleyton estate, having come by descent to Lord Sidney
Godolphin-Osborne, was sold by him, in 1844, to Samuel Morton Peto, Esq.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1210" id="Page_1210">[1210]</a></span>
the extensive “contractor,” who had become the purchaser of the Norwich
and Lowestoft ship canal, and to whose enterprise Lowestoft owes its railway,
its pier, its harbour, &amp;c. By Samuel Morton Peto the old mansion
was entirely rearranged, extended, and altered; and by him also was the
church, in a measure, rebuilt, and the village entirely remodelled, at a large
outlay.</p>

<p>We should neglect an essential part of our duty if we omitted to do
tender homage to that most enterprising and liberal gentleman. He
“created” Somerleyton, so to speak, made it the grand and beautiful
edifice it now is, formed its grounds, constructed and ornamented its
delicious winter garden, hung the rooms with pictures, and filled the
library with useful and pleasant books. Unhappily, circumstances prevented
his enjoying them. Fortune, ever capricious, consigned it to other
hands; the rich contractor had to sustain a reverse, and the “earthly
paradise” passed from his hands into those of another. Happily, however,
that other was the well-known late Sir Francis Crossley, who became the
owner of the property, by purchase, in 1862.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Crossley had no pedigree to trace; his father was a self-made
man, and he a self-made millionaire. His father was a journeyman
carpet-weaver; his mother, herself a farmer’s daughter, was a farm servant.
The mother lived to a ripe old age; the father to start the now famous
firm of Crossley and Sons, and see it in a fair way to success. The humble
origin of Sir Francis Crossley was a matter which he loved unostentatiously
to trace. “Many years after the marriage,” he related on one occasion,
“my father and mother took Dean Clough Mills. As my mother went with
her usual energy to that place, down the yard at four o’clock in the
morning, she made a vow&mdash;‘If the Lord does bless us at this place, the
poor shall taste of it.’ It is to this vow, given with so much faithfulness,
and kept with so much fidelity, that I attribute the great success my father
had in business.” Sir Francis Crossley’s benefactions were large. To the
town of Halifax, in 1857, he gave the People’s Park, at a cost of about
£40,000. About 1861 there was commenced the erection of the Crossley
Orphan Home and School on Skircoat Moor, which was built and endowed
by Messrs. John, Francis, and Joseph Crossley, at a cost of £65,000. The
building has accommodation for four hundred children. It was provided
by the Messrs. Crossley with an endowment of £3,000 a year, but this
sum has been increased from other sources. In 1871 he gave £10,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1211" id="Page_1211">[1211]</a></span>
to the Corporation of Halifax as a loan fund for the benefit of deserving
inhabitants. Out of this fund men may borrow to the extent of £300, and
women to the extent of £100, at 2½ per cent., on certain conditions, one
being that £10 of the principal shall be paid back annually. Then he gave
£10,000 to the Congregational Pastors’ Retiring Fund; £10,000 to a fund for
the relief of widows of Congregational pastors; and £20,000 to the London
Missionary Society&mdash;making a total within a short time of £60,000. He was
a member of the Independent body, but he was a liberal contributor to every
good cause. Sir Francis was born in 1817, and from 1852 to 1859 sat as
M.P. for Halifax; from 1859 to 1865 for the West Riding of Yorkshire;
from 1865 to 1868 for the North-west Riding; and from the latter year
until 1872 for the north division of the West Riding of the same county;
having thus sat in Parliament for an unbroken period of twenty years. He
married, in 1845, Martha Eliza, daughter of the late Henry Brinton, Esq., of
Kidderminster, by whom he left issue an only surviving child, the present
Sir Savile Brinton Crossley. Sir Francis was created a baronet in 1863.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1212" id="Page_1212">[1212]</a></span></p>

<p>The present baronet, and owner of the immense estates and wealth of
Sir Francis, is his son, Sir Savile Brinton Crossley, who was born in 1857,
and succeeded to the title in 1872.</p>

<p>The arms of Crossley are&mdash;<i>gules</i>, a chevron indented, <i>ermine</i>, between two
cross-crosslets in chief, and a saltire couped in base, <i>or</i>. Crest&mdash;a demi-hind
erased, <i>proper</i>, charged with two bars, <i>or</i>, and holding between the feet
a cross-crosslet, <i>or</i>. Motto&mdash;“Omne bonum ab alto.” The family seats
are Somerleyton, near Lowestoft, in Suffolk, and Belle Vue, Halifax,
Yorkshire.</p>

<p>The old hall of Somerleyton was one of the finest of the old brick
mansions remaining, and possessed many interesting features. Fuller, the
quaint old writer whose words are so often quoted, ranked it among the
best of the many fine houses of the county of Suffolk, and says that it well
deserved the name of Somerleyton, for here summer is to be seen in the
depth of winter&mdash;the grounds being planted with evergreens, and the
pleasant walks beset on both sides with fir-trees, green all the year round,
besides other curiosities.</p>

<p>The Park, about two hundred acres in extent, is rich in beauty, and includes
a deer park. Two miles from the house, in the direction of Yarmouth,
there is a drive through ornamental grounds, and a “decoy” on a splendid
sheet of water three miles long, and a quarter of a mile in breadth, called
Fritton Lake. It abounds with a variety of fish, and is the resort of
widgeons, ducks, teal, grebes, and other wild fowl during the season, which
begins in October and ends in April. Vast quantities are taken yearly.
The banks of this fine sheet of water are fringed with wood, and two or
three gentlemen’s houses and pleasure-grounds add interest to the scenery.
The lake separates the parishes of Fritton, Herringfleet, Belton, Lound, and
Ashby; and in the Herringfleet woods, belonging to Major Leathes, there
is a heronry. The owner of Somerleyton, to whom belongs a large portion
of the lake, has a beautiful drive on one side of it, extending for nearly two
miles, winding through plantations comprising choice specimens of pines,
&amp;c., with occasional peeps of the lake on one side, and heath and woods on
the other. The lake&mdash;such is its natural and yet cultivated beauty&mdash;might
be a bit of the lovely shire of Devon planted among the bare plains of
Suffolk. It is zig-zag in form; tiny peninsulas jut into it, clothed with
graceful firs and thick underwood, among which tall ferns luxuriate; the
steeps have gradual ascents from the banks; closely planted trees of many
varieties completely cover them; and it is only now and then that glimpses
are caught of the water.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>In the Winter Garden. Spanish Dancers, Hautmann.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The lake is close and compact, and on no side
does there seem any opening, only footpaths lead to it from the adjacent
roads. Its solitary character&mdash;out of the way of passing intruders&mdash;and
its thickness of composition, render it a favourite shelter of wild fowl. They
do not, however, enjoy solitude in security. Man is always astir in search of
prey: three “decoys” are active at all seasons to entrap the unsuspicious
and unwary. One of them was in operation during our visit. Domestic
ducks were sailing in and out of a narrow passage, quacking and playing
and feeding, to show their wild cousins outside that no danger was near.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1214" id="Page_1214">[1214]</a></span>
Two or three bolder than the rest summoned courage to enter, and very soon
were in the net-trap that furnished the bag of the gamekeeper.</p>

<p>This charming scene of mingled wood and water adds materially to the
attractions of the locality; and here Art has been brought to the aid of
Nature.</p>

<p>Passing in at the North Lodge, visitors are generally conducted through
the kitchen and fruit gardens, the vineries, hothouses, and conservatories,
to a sloping lawn facing the Winter Garden and north front of the house,
from which point a charming scene presents itself. “Before us,” says a
recent writer, “in a setting of old forest trees, cedars, aged thorns, clumps
of azaleas, and rhododendrons, rises, as if evoked by a magician’s wand, a
range of fantastic palaces of glass, their many sheeny domes and pinnacles
sparkling like diamond facets in the noonday sun, and their contours and
traceried outlines of graceful arabesques backed and thrown into relief by
the deep red brick-work of the towers, gables, and campaniles of the hall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1215" id="Page_1215">[1215]</a></span></p>

<p>On the left is an aviary of gold and silver pheasants, screening a part of the
offices. The area covered by the Winter Garden is one hundred feet square.
Within the decorations are Renaissance, of a light and elegant character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1216" id="Page_1216">[1216]</a></span>
Four main alleys converge under the great mosque dome, beneath which is
a fountain supported on a rockery of ferns by four dolphins, and surmounted
by a marble statue of the “Nymph of the Lily.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>In the Winter Garden. Nymph at her Toilet, Haudmauer.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From the central alley
numerous aisles diverge to an outer one, circumscribing the building. The
roof is supported by light iron columns covered with fuchsias and beautiful
creepers, with wire baskets of flowers suspended overhead. Parterres of
rare exotics, and large majolica vases filled with flowers, occupy the grand
space. At the corners and in other parts are life-sized statues: mirrors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1217" id="Page_1217">[1217]</a></span>
other appliances add to the beauty of the whole. The south side opens to
the Billiard, Morning, and Withdrawing Rooms. Aviaries of singing-birds
are placed at intervals throughout the garden, and in the corridor leading
to the Palm-house are a fern-grotto and fountain. The whole, it should be
specially noted, may be lit with gas.</p>

<p>From the Winter Garden the visitor is shown the Italian Garden, opposite
the west front. This front of the house opens upon a noble terrace,
three hundred feet in length, enriched with statuary, vases, &amp;c., from which
three flights of steps lead down to the Dutch Garden, laid out in geometrical
form by Nesfield, in the same general manner as that by him at Castle
Howard, which we have heretofore described. In the centre of this
parterre is a noble sundial, and from this point, looking to the south, a
view is obtained of the grand avenue of fine old lime-trees, four hundred
and fifty yards in length, at the termination of which the Church of
Somerleyton is seen. Near to this avenue, in which are some fine
sculptured figures and groups and other objects, is a double avenue of
elm-trees. In this garden will be especially noticed two admirably
sculptured figures of “Night” and “Morning,” by the late John Thomas,
an artist of eminence and great ability, whose advice is understood to
have greatly guided Sir Morton Peto in the adornment of the beautiful
house; he may, indeed, be described as “the architect.” There is also
(but on the other side of the Winter Garden) a drinking-fountain,
created by a statue, the work of Joseph Durham, A.R.A., of a milkmaid,
her pail at her feet, in an attitude that implies outlook for the kine.</p>

<p>The West Front, one hundred and fifty feet in length, is composed of
a central tower and two wings, with large bay windows. The entrance is
by a porch in the central tower.</p>

<p>The Corridor, lined with wainscot, leads to a finely panelled Hall, from
which a staircase ascends to the upper suites of apartments. The Hall is
hung with arms and curious and valuable armour, one suit of which, of
remarkably fine design and the most exquisite workmanship, is inlaid with
gold, and bears a German motto, and the date 1652. Over the massive
chimney-piece the wall is decorated by Maclise’s large oil-painting of
“Chivalry.” It contains also other valuable works of Art; among them a
fine picture of deer by Sir Edwin Landseer, in his best manner and his
best time. In the stained-glass windows are the arms of some of the successive
owners of Somerleyton&mdash;Allin, Anguish, Godolphin-Osborne, Peto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1218" id="Page_1218">[1218]</a></span>
Crossley, &amp;c. On the landing is a portrait-picture of George and Robert
Stephenson, and in the passage from the Staircase to the Boudoir are
“Edward the Confessor leaving his Crown to Harold,” and “Harold’s Oath
to William, Duke of Normandy,” pictures of great merit by John Cross.
There is also in the Hall a grand colossal statue of Æneas. In the
outer Hall&mdash;placed on a very graceful pedestal&mdash;is a marble statue of a
boy who has been gathering shells by the seashore; it is a portrait-statue
of the present baronet, and is one of the charming works of
Joseph Durham, A.R.A.</p>

<p>The Dining-hall, which is two stories in height, has a rich carved polychrome
ceiling in compartments, and cornices of oak, with gilt reliefs, and
clusters of fruit and wreaths of flowers. It has a huge pyramidal chimney-piece,
supported by two full-length caryatides, “Summer” and “Winter,”
by John Thomas. The ceiling is carried on brackets supported by heads of
the roebuck, wild boar, &amp;c. In the stained-glass windows are medallion-portraits
of Newton, Watt, Chaucer, Shakspere, Wren, and Reynolds,
surmounted by allegorical figures of the liberal sciences. On either side the
fire-place are <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i> of Stanfield fitted into panels, and above these are
frescoes by Maclise and Horsley. The furniture is massive and appropriate,
and a fine minstrel’s gallery adds much to the beauty of the room. In this
gallery is a fine mechanical orchestral organ. The two paintings by Stanfield
are, we believe, the largest in size of his productions, and undoubtedly
his best works. They are so well known as to need no description here: one
is the Storming of St. Sebastian, the other the dismantled <i>Victory</i> towed into
Gibraltar after the battle of Trafalgar. These are monuments to the
memory of one of the greatest painters of any age. In this most beautiful
room also hang a “St. Simeon,” by Guido, and a large and very fine
example of G. Lance: it is called “The Seneschal,” and is certainly the
best work of this artist.</p>

<p>The Breakfast-room, a charming apartment filled with choice objects,
commands a view down one of the avenues; in it are the “Italian
Peasants,” by Armitage, landscapes by Constable, a fruit-piece by
Hunt, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Library has a beautiful ceiling, and is fitted with carved book-cases,
containing editions of all modern authors. In the extensive collection few
works of merit and interest are omitted. Over the chimney-piece, with its
motto, “Learn to live, live to learn,” is Rembrandt’s grand picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1219" id="Page_1219">[1219]</a></span>
“Ferdinand and Isabella;” and there are also portraits of Milton and
Shakspere, the latter a “life” portrait from Stowe.</p>

<p>The old Drawing-room is wainscoted throughout, and the cornices,
door-heads, and mirror-frame are exquisitely and elaborately carved with
game, and groups and festoons of fruit and flowers, attributed to Gibbons.
In the upper lights of tho windows, of modern insertion, landscapes are
introduced.</p>

<p>The Drawing-room, Billiard-room, and other apartments are all of
equal elegance, and all filled with costly furniture and choice works of
Art, among which are paintings by Beverley, Lance, Solomon, Mole, and
others.</p>

<p>In the upper rooms of the house&mdash;not, of course, shown to visitors&mdash;is
preserved the ancient tapestry which adorned the walls of the old mansion;
and here, too, are many gems of Art, including examples of Wright of
Derby, Wilson, Bright, and others; with Manuel’s “Voyage Subjects,”
twenty-two in number. The subjects of the tapestry are as follows:&mdash;In
the Tapestry-room, the “Story of Lucretia;” in the Dressing-room,
portions of a very large tapestry, “The Passage of the Red Sea,” “Moses
striking the Rock,” &amp;c. The “Story of Lucretia” is in five panels, very
beautifully wrought, obviously from the designs of an accomplished artist.
There are also pictures of great worth in some of these rooms; notably
a portrait by Holbein of his mother, a series of charming drawings by
Henry Bright, and several fine proof engravings of great pictures. Many
of the pieces of furniture were purchased at Stowe, and are of great
rarity and worth&mdash;brilliant examples of Art of a past but honoured age.</p>

<p>The Business-room is a finely groined apartment, hung with rich old
tapestry, and contains, among other works of Art, three pictures by
Herring, one attributed to Rubens, and some good examples of the old
Dutch masters.</p>

<p>The Stables (flanked by a clock-tower of much elegance) lie to the
right of the main entrance; they are models of architectural beauty, and
are, of course, fitted up with all the modern appliances of comfort and
convenience.</p>

<p>In the Church of Somerleyton are preserved the old rood-screen, containing
sixteen painted panels of saints, and some of the monuments from
the older edifice. Among these are memorials to Admiral Sir Thomas Allin,
to Sir John Wentworth and his lady, and to Sir Thomas Jernegan&mdash;an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1220" id="Page_1220">[1220]</a></span>
altar-tomb, on which, according to Weever and Camden, there was
formerly the inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Jesu Christ, both God and Man,<br />
Save thy servant Jernegan.”</p>

<p class="p1">On the front of the tomb are three, and at each end one, lozenge-formed
panels, in each of which is a quatrefoil with trefoiled cusps. In the centre
of each is a shield of arms. On the top of the tomb are places where brasses
have at one time been fixed. Among the arms are Appleyard impaled with
Jernegan. This tomb has been much impaired by time. It is now, however,
carefully preserved.</p>

<p>Another slab bears the inscription, “Margaret Jernegan, the wyef of
Edward Jernegan, Esquyer, daughter of Sir Edmund Bedingfelde, Knt.,
which Margaret dyed the xxiiij of Marche, anno <span class="smcap lowercase">MDIII.</span>”</p>

<p>The monument to Sir John Wentworth and his lady bears figures of the
knight in armour, with the peaked beard of the times, and the lady habited
in a plain dress; an escutcheon has the arms of Wentworth, <i>azure</i>, a saltire,
<i>ermine</i>, between four eagles displayed, <i>or</i>; impaling Soame, <i>gules</i>, a chevron
between three mullets, <i>or</i>, quartered with, second, <i>azure</i>, two bars gemelles
and a canton, <i>or</i>, charged with a tun, and, third, <i>gules</i>, six annulets, <i>or</i>.</p>

<p>The memorial to Sir Thomas Allin is a tablet bearing the following
inscription:&mdash;“Near this place lies interred Sir Thomas Allin, Bart., whose
unshaken fidelity to his sovereign, Charles ye 2nd, was rewarded with many
marks of his royal favour, having had the honour of serving him as Admiral
in his fleets, in the British and Mediterranean Seas; Controller of the
Navy, Captain of Sandgate Castle, and Master of the Trinity House. He
died in 1686 in ye 73 year of his age.”</p>

<p>The Church is seen from many parts of the grounds of Somerleyton Hall&mdash;always
a pleasant object in the landscape&mdash;through a grand avenue of
elms: a wood-walk footpath leads to it from the house. A fine piece of
the park forms a portion of the glebe. The Church is dedicated to St. Mary.
A singular and interesting octangular font (in some parts recut), with an
inscription, now illegible, is one of its few remains of antiquity.</p>

<p>There is also a small modern Chapel at a little distance from the house,
where service is held on Sundays. It was originally erected as a Baptist
chapel by Sir Morton Peto. Close to it is a Maze of dwarf yews, kept with
exceeding nicety: in the centre is a graceful temple, from the seats of which
views are obtained of the gardens and conservatories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1221" id="Page_1221">[1221]</a></span></p>

<p>The Conservatories are of great extent, divided into “houses” for all
the rarer plants, with vineries, pine-pits, and all the other accessories of
abundance at every season of the year.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Somerleyton Church.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The principal entrance to the mansion is through iron gates, the stone
piers, supporting deer <i>couchant</i>, sculptured by John Thomas. This view
we have engraved on page 207: it is at once graceful and commanding.</p>

<p>Somerleyton is a magnificent house, but it was erected with a view to
comfort as well as elegance; all the rooms, both above and below, are
so constructed as to suggest the idea of home; the “appliances and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1222" id="Page_1222">[1222]</a></span>
means” of wealth have been judiciously exerted to promote the rational
enjoyment of life; ease has not been sacrificed to state; and grandeur has
been less studied than content. The house is splendid, and yet homely;
there is none of the burden of magnificence either in the mansion or the
grounds, while ostentation seems as far removed from the lofty and munificently
furnished apartments as from those which ornament a simple
cottage dwelling.</p>

<p>Its perfect architectural details, its noble conservatories, its garden, its
avenues&mdash;one of elm, another of lime trees, stretching from the house
across the park&mdash;its numerous vases and statues, happily placed&mdash;and
especially its Winter Garden&mdash;all perfect when viewed separately, and all
joined in admirable harmony&mdash;render Somerleyton remarkable among the
most beautiful modern mansions of the kingdom, and do honour to the
sculptor-architect under whose superintendence it was planned and
executed. Somerleyton, therefore, may be described as one of the gems
of the county of Suffolk&mdash;a county rich in baronial mansions, abundant
of historic events, and full of traditions of the earliest, as well as of
mediæval, ages in England.</p>

<p>It would be a long list that which gave even the names of the baronial
halls in this grand historic county, and it would far exceed our space
to give details of its ancient monuments&mdash;Roman, Saxon, Danish, and
Norman&mdash;to say nothing of those that have descended to us from the
still earlier Britons, many relics of whom are yet to be found in the
neighbourhood. Suffolk is, indeed, if less graced by natural beauties
than some other of our English shires, rich among the richest of them in
antiquities and in traditions, while it has a high and prominent place in
British history.</p>

<p>The scenery that neighbours Somerleyton is purely English; the lanes
are pleasant and picturesque in spring and summer; the land is productive;
the broad river Waveney fertilises miles upon miles of green or arable
banks between which it runs; the trees have prodigious growth; and,
above all, the sea is near at hand; the German Ocean rolls its waves into
the harbours of these eastern shores, bearing the wealth that thousands of
hardy fishermen gather in during every month of the year.</p>

<p>From any of the heights, which, though not numerous, occur occasionally,
and, in a degree, from any of the roads that skirt the shore, may
be seen a “multitudinous shipping,” so to say, from the huge three-master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1223" id="Page_1223">[1223]</a></span>
and the grand steamship to the comparatively small fishing-smacks
that dot the sea-scape, and the heavily weighted coal vessels that are
bearing sources of wealth to all parts of the world. It is to the fishing-smacks
the locality is mainly indebted for its prosperity; but Lowestoft
now holds rank among the fashionable and most frequented sea watering-places
of the kingdom.</p>

<p class="dc16">WE do not refer to the earlier families who held
the title of Earls, &amp;c., of Pembroke&mdash;those of
Montgomery, of Clare, of Marshall, of De Valence,
and of Hastings&mdash;as they, although the predecessors
of the Herberts in the title, were not so
in regard to the estates. It has been well said
by Sir Bernard Burke that “the name of Pembroke,
like the scutcheons and monuments in
some time-honoured cathedral, cannot fail to
awaken a thousand glorious recollections in the
bosoms of all who are but tolerably read in English
chronicles. Sound it, and no trumpet of ancient or
modern chivalry would peal a higher war-note. It
is almost superfluous to repeat that this is the family
of which it has been so finely said, that ‘all the
men were brave, and all the women chaste;’ and
what nobler record was ever engraved upon the tomb
of departed greatness?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1225" id="Page_1225">[1225]</a></span></p>

<p>We commence our notes with William ap Thomas,
whose ancestors traced back to Henry Fitz-Herbert,
chamberlain to King Henry I. This Sir William ap
Thomas (who was the son of Thomas ap Gwillim ap
Jenkin, by his wife Maud, daughter and heiress of Sir John Morley,
Knight, Lord of Raglan Castle) married Gladys, daughter of Sir Richard
Gam, and widow of Sir Roger Vaughan, by whom he had three sons
and a daughter. The eldest of these sons was “created Lord of Raglan,
Chepstow, and Gower, and commanded to assume the surname of Herbert,
in honour of his ancestor,” the chamberlain to King Henry I., and afterwards
Earl of Pembroke. “He was succeeded by his son, who renounced
the earldom of Pembroke for that of Huntingdon, at the request of King
Edward IV., that monarch being anxious to dignify his son, Prince
Edward, with the title of Earl of Pembroke.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Principal Front.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The honour, however,
reverted to the Herberts in the reign of Edward VI., who conferred it upon
Sir William Herbert.” This William Herbert, who had married Anne,
sister of Queen Catherine Parr, was knighted by Henry VIII., and was
appointed executor, or “conservator,” of the King’s will; and shared
with Sir Anthony Denny the honour of riding to Windsor in the chariot
with the royal corpse, when Henry’s ashes were committed to their final
resting-place. By Edward VI. Sir William was elevated to the peerage
by the titles of Baron Herbert of Cardiff and Earl of Pembroke. In 1551
his wife, the Countess of Pembroke, “died at Baynard’s Castle, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1226" id="Page_1226">[1226]</a></span>
carried into St. Paul’s in this order: first, there went an hundred poor
men and women in mantle-freez gowns; next followed the heralds, and
then the corse, about which were eight bannerels of armes, then came
the mourners, lordes, knights, and gentlemen; after them the ladies and
gentlewomen mourners, to the number of 200 in all; next came in coats
200 of her own and other servants. She was interred by the tomb of the
Duke of Lancaster; and after, her banners were set up over her, and her
armes set on divers pillars.” The Earl died March 17th, 1569-70, and was
succeeded by his son Henry as Earl of Pembroke. This nobleman was
thrice married; first, to Catherine, daughter of Henry Grey, Duke of
Suffolk, from whom he was afterwards divorced; secondly, to Catherine,
daughter of George, Earl of Shrewsbury; and, thirdly, to Mary Sidney,
daughter to Sir Henry Sidney, Knight of the Garter, by his wife, the
Lady Mary, daughter of John, Duke of Northumberland. This lady, the
third wife of the Earl of Pembroke, was sister to one of the greatest of all
great Englishmen&mdash;Sir Philip Sidney; and it was for her special delight
that he, while visiting her at Wilton, wrote his inimitable “Arcadia.”
By this lady the Earl of Pembroke had two sons, William and Philip,
both of whom in turn succeeded to the earldom. The Countess, “Sidney’s
sister, Pembroke’s mother,” “a principal ornament to the family of the
Sidneys,” and of whom Spenser wrote that she was</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The gentlest shepherdess that liv’d that day,<br />
And most resembling, both in shape and spirit,<br />
Her brother dear,”</p>

<p class="pn1">survived her husband some time, and at her death, which took place in
1621, that beautiful epitaph so often quoted, and as often erroneously
ascribed to Ben Jonson, was penned by William Browne, and will bear again
quoting here:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Underneath this sable hearse<br />
Lies the subject of all verse;<br />
<i>Sidney’s</i> sister! <i>Pembroke’s</i> mother!<br />
Death, ere thou hast slain another<br />
Fair, and learn’d, and good as she,<br />
Time shall throw a dart at thee!<br />
Marble piles let no man raise<br />
To her name for after days;<br />
Some kind woman, born as she,<br />
Reading this, like Niobe<br />
Shall turn marble, and become<br />
Both her mourner and her tomb.”</p>

<p class="p1">William, third Earl of Pembroke under the new creation, eldest son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1227" id="Page_1227">[1227]</a></span>
the Earl and of “Sidney’s sister,” succeeded to the title and estates on the
death of his father in 1600-1. Of him Aubrey says, “He was of a most
noble person, and the glory of the court in the reigne of King James and
King Charles. He was handsome and of an admirable presence.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">‘Gratior et pulchro veniens a corpore virtus.’</p>

<p class="p1">He was the greatest Mecænas to learned men of any peer of his time&mdash;or
since. He was very generous and open-handed. He gave a noble collection
of choice bookes and manuscripts to the Bodleian Library at Oxford,
which remain there as an honourable monument of his munificence. ‘Twas
thought, had he not been suddenly snatcht away by death, to the grief of
all learned and good men, that he would have been a great benefactor to
Pembroke College, in Oxford; whereas, there remains only from him a
great piece of plate that he gave there. He was a good scholar, and
delighted in poetrie; and did sometimes, for his diversion, write some
sonnets and epigrammes which deserve commendation. Some of them are
in print in a little book in 8vo., intituled ‘Poems writt by William, Earle
of Pembroke, and Sir Benjamin Ruddyer, Knight, 1660.’”</p>

<p>His lordship married Mary, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Gilbert,
seventh Earl of Shrewsbury, by his countess, Mary, daughter of Sir
William Cavendish, of Chatsworth, and his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick&mdash;“Bess
of Hardwick”&mdash;afterwards Countess of Shrewsbury. By this marriage
the Earl of Pembroke had two sons, who died in their infancy.
Dying without surviving issue, he was succeeded in the title and estates
by his brother, Philip Herbert, who thus became fourth Earl of Pembroke,
and was shortly afterwards created Earl of Montgomery, and appointed
Lord Chamberlain, Gentleman of the King’s Bed-chamber, and Lord Warden
of the Stannaries. He was twice married: first, to Lady Susan Vere,
daughter to the Earl of Oxford, by whom he had a numerous family;
and, secondly, to Anne, daughter and heiress of George, Earl of Cumberland,
and widow of Richard, Earl of Dorset.</p>

<p>Dying in 1649-51, the Earl was succeeded by his fourth but eldest
surviving son, Philip, as Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery. This nobleman
married, first, Penelope, daughter and heiress of Sir Robert Naunton;
and, secondly, Catherine, daughter of Sir William Villiers, and, dying in
1669-70, was in his turn succeeded by the eldest son of his first marriage,
William, who, dying unmarried, was succeeded by his half-brother, Philip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1228" id="Page_1228">[1228]</a></span>
(the son of his father by his second wife), who thus became seventh Earl
of Pembroke, and fourth Earl of Montgomery. This nobleman married
Henrietta de Querouaille, sister to the Duchess of Portsmouth, but dying
without male issue, the title and estates devolved on his younger brother,
Thomas, eighth Earl of Pembroke, who held distinguished offices under
William III., Queen Anne, and George I., and was the founder of the
noble collection of sculptures, &amp;c., at Wilton. His lordship married three
times, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Henry, as ninth earl, of whose
taste Lord Orford says, “Besides his works at Wilton, the new lodge in
Windsor Park, the Countess of Suffolk’s house at Marble Hill, Twickenham,
the water house in Lord Orford’s park at Houghton, are incontestable
proofs of his taste: it was more than taste, it was passion for the
utility and honour of his country, that engaged his lordship to promote
and assiduously overlook the construction of Westminster Bridge by the
ingenious Monsieur Labeyle.”</p>

<p>He was succeeded in the title and estates by his son, Henry, as tenth
Earl of Pembroke and Earl of Montgomery, who, marrying Elizabeth,
second daughter of Charles Spencer, Duke of Marlborough, had issue one
son and one daughter, and, dying in 1794, was succeeded by his son, George
Augustus Herbert, as eleventh Earl of Pembroke, &amp;c.</p>

<p>That nobleman married, first, in 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of Topham
Beauclerk, Esq., son of Lord Sidney Beauclerk, and by her, who died in
1793, had issue the Lady Diana, married to the Earl of Normanton, and
one son, Robert Henry, who succeeded him; and, secondly, in 1808,
Catherine, daughter of Count Woronzow, the Russian ambassador, by
whom he had issue one son, the Hon. Sidney Herbert, M.P., and Secretary
for War, created, in 1861, Lord Herbert of Lea (which title has now
merged into the earldom of Pembroke), and five daughters&mdash;viz. the Lady
Elizabeth, married to the Earl of Clanwilliam; the Lady Mary Caroline; the
Lady Catherine; the Lady Georgiana; and the Lady Emma. His lordship,
dying in 1827, was succeeded by the son of his first marriage, Robert
Henry Herbert, as twelfth Earl of Pembroke, &amp;c. This nobleman was
born in 1791, and married, in 1814, the Princess Octavia Spinelli, daughter
of the Duke of Lorraine, and widow of the Sicilian Prince Buttera de
Rubari, by whom he had no issue. He died in 1862, and (his half-brother,
Sidney Herbert, Baron Herbert of Lea, the heir to the title, having died a
few months before him) was succeeded by his nephew (the son of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1229" id="Page_1229">[1229]</a></span>
honoured statesman), George Robert Charles Herbert, the present peer&mdash;the
thirteenth earl&mdash;then a minor.</p>

<p>The Right Hon. Sidney Herbert, who was born in 1810, married, in
1846, Elizabeth, only daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles Ashe A’Court,
who survives him, and is the present Baroness Herbert of Lea. By her
he had issue four sons and three daughters&mdash;viz. George Robert Charles
Herbert, now Earl of Pembroke; Sidney, Lord Herbert, who is heir-presumptive
to his brother, and was born in 1853; William Reginald
Herbert, born in 1854; Michael Henry Herbert, born in 1857; Mary
Catherine Herbert, born in 1849; Elizabeth Maude Herbert, born in 1851;
and Constance Gwladys, born in 1859. Lord Herbert of Lea died in
1861, and was succeeded in that title by his eldest son, George Robert
Charles Herbert, then eleven years of age, and who, eight months later,
succeeded to the full family estates and earldom.</p>

<p>The present peer, the Right Hon. George Robert Charles, thirteenth
Earl of Pembroke, Earl of Montgomery, Baron Herbert of Cardiff, Baron
Herbert of Shurland, and Baron Herbert of Lea, Hereditary Visitor of
Jesus College, Oxford, and High Steward of Wilton, was born July 6th,
1850, and succeeded his father as second Baron Herbert of Lea, in 1861, and
his uncle as Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, &amp;c., in 1862. His lordship,
in 1874, married the Lady Gertrude Frances Talbot, daughter of the
eighteenth Earl of Shrewsbury, and sister of the present earl.</p>

<p>The arms of the Earl of Pembroke are&mdash;party per pale, <i>azure</i> and <i>gules</i>,
three lions rampant, <i>argent</i>. The crest is a wyvern, <i>vert</i>, holding in its
mouth a sinister hand couped at the wrist, <i>gules</i>. The supporters are&mdash;dexter,
a panther guardant, <i>argent</i>, incensed, spotted, <i>or</i>, <i>vert</i>, <i>sable</i>, <i>azure</i>,
and <i>gules</i> alternately, ducally collared, <i>azure</i>; sinister, a lion, <i>argent</i>, ducally
collared, <i>or</i>. Motto&mdash;“Ung je serviray.” The Earl is patron of twelve
livings, ten of which are in Wiltshire, one in Dorsetshire, and one in
Shropshire.</p>

<p>His lordship’s brothers and sisters, children of Lord Herbert of Lea,
were, on his succeeding to the earldom, raised to the rank of earls’ children
by royal warrant in 1862.</p>

<p>Wilton, a town of “great antiquity,” is situated at the conflux of the
rivers Nadder and Willey, from the latter of which it is said to derive its
name&mdash;“Willytown” or “Wilton:” “in Latin it is called Ellandunum.”
The ancient Britons had one of their chief seats here; it was a capital of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1230" id="Page_1230">[1230]</a></span>
the West Saxons, and was undoubtedly famous long before the Norman
Conquest. Afterwards it obtained renown from the number and importance
of its monastic establishments. Leland informs us that it had over twelve
parish churches. Of its abbey there are no remains. It was dissolved in
the thirty-fifth year of King Henry VIII., and the site and buildings
given to Sir William Herbert, afterwards created Earl of Pembroke; while
from its relics Wilton House was principally built.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Wilton, from the River.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Wilton House&mdash;one of the grandest and most beautiful in the kingdom,
and the entrance to which adjoins the town&mdash;stands on the site of a
monastery of Saxon foundation, which, on the dissolution, was levelled
with the ground. As we have just intimated, no portion whatever of the
monastic buildings remains, but there can be no doubt they were of considerable
extent and importance. The mansion was built partly from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1231" id="Page_1231">[1231]</a></span>
designs, it is said, of Hans Holbein, to whom is ascribed the porch, which,
however, in the early part of the present century was much altered. “The
garden front was built by M. Solomon de Caus in the reign of Charles I.,
and, having been destroyed by fire in 1648, was re-erected by Webb from
plans which are presumed to have been furnished by Inigo Jones. In the
commencement of the present century the house was considerably enlarged
and remodelled by James Wyatt, R.A., one of the principal additions
being the cloisters for the display and preservation of the magnificent
collection of sculptures. The general plan of the house is a hollow square,
the glazed cloister occupying the central space.”</p>

<p>In this Cloister, and in the Hall that leads to it, are the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1232" id="Page_1232">[1232]</a></span>
“marbles” which form so prominent a feature in the attractions of
Wilton&mdash;statues, busts, bassi-relievi, urns, vases, fragments of various
kinds&mdash;a wonderful assemblage of remains of Greece and Rome.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The
collection was formed towards the close of the last century by Thomas, Earl
of Pembroke, who purchased such of the Earl of Arundel’s collection as
had been placed in the house, which were principally busts; to these he
added many purchased at the dispersion of the Giustiniani collection of
marbles, and also at the dispersion of the Mazarin collection, and from
various other sources.</p>

<p>The Hall contains several statues; but its interest is derived from the
many suits of armour by which it is adorned: they are chiefly trophies
and memorials of the battle of St. Quentin, fought in 1557, in which the
Earl of Pembroke commanded the forces of England. One of the suits was
worn by the Earl, and two of them were, it is said, worn by the Constable
Montmorency and the Duc de Montpensier, both taken prisoners at that
eventful fight. A passage from the Hall leads to the Cloisters, from
which, on either side, are entrances to the various apartments: these are
furnished with judgment and taste, but their attractions are the pictures
that adorn the walls.</p>

<p>The renowned “family picture” by Vandyke is beyond question the
great painter’s masterpiece: it is 17 feet in length, by 11 feet in height, and
fills one end of the drawing-room. It contains ten whole-length figures,
the two principal of which are Philip, Earl of Pembroke, and his lady,
Susan, daughter of Edward, Earl of Oxford. On the right stand their three
sons, on the left their daughter and her husband, Robert, Earl of Carnarvon.
Before them is Lady Mary, the wife of Charles, Lord Herbert, and above
them, in the clouds, are two sons and a daughter who died young. It
is a most grand and glorious work, the value of which is not to be estimated
by money.</p>

<p>The room, which is called also the Cube Room, contains some thirteen
other pictures, the productions of Vandyke.</p>

<p>Other of the great old masters are well represented in the several apartments
of the mansion: many of them are, indeed, of great beauty and
value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1233" id="Page_1233">[1233]</a></span></p>

<p>We might occupy much space by printing a list of these pictures: they
comprise a large number of the great Italian artists. They are, however,
such as one usually meets in these palatial residences, and are thrown into
comparative obscurity by the glorious assemblage of Vandykes.</p>

<p>In Lady Pembroke’s Summer Dressing-room there is a Gothic window
by Price, “to whom Parliament granted £5,000 for having discovered the
ancient method of staining glass.”</p>

<p>The house is made thoroughly comfortable as a home; it has never
been abandoned by the family, but has been their continual residence.
Everywhere, consequently, there is an aspect of thorough comfort. Grace,
elegance, and indeed splendour, are sufficiently apparent, but the obvious
study has long been to render the dwelling in all respects the abode of an
English nobleman who loved to live among his own people. None will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1234" id="Page_1234">[1234]</a></span>
wonder at this who knew the late Lord Herbert of Lea, who so long and
so continuously lived in that delightful home.</p>

<p>To the Gardens and Grounds of Wilton House we desire to direct the
reader’s especial attention; they have been by no means left solely to the
guardianship of Nature. Art has done much to give aid to the beauties of
hill and dell, and river and wooded slopes and pasture-land. Immediately
around the mansion the skill of the gardener is manifest: trim walks,
and pastures, and summer-houses, and conservatories add to the natural
grace and beauty of the scene. One garden especially, into which there is
a passage from the Drawing-room, is very beautifully laid out, overlooked
by a graceful arcade, in which are vases and busts, and to which,
no doubt, the family and their guests often retreat to enjoy the bounties of
free air and light among the adornments that are here so lavish.</p>

<p>A most picturesque and singularly beautiful bridge joins the park to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1235" id="Page_1235">[1235]</a></span>
grounds, crossing the Nadder. It was built from a design by Palladio, and
has an open Ionic colonnade. The park slopes up from the river; and in
the grounds are some of the finest cedars to be seen in England.</p>

<p>Here, it is said, Sir Philip Sidney wrote the “Arcadia;” and the
memorable book bears conclusive evidence that he drew much of his
inspiration from these gardens and grounds. The book may be, as Milton
styles it, “a vain amatorious poem;” but it is full of beautiful descriptions
of Nature, and shows how dearly the chivalric writer really loved the natural
and the true; and it demands no strong stretch of fancy to imagine Philip
Sidney, accompanied by William Shakspere, Edmund Spenser, and Philip
Massinger (he was born in the place, and probably in the house), walking
among these now aged trees, along these embowered walks, and by the
banks of the fair river that runs to enrich them as it did centuries ago:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And all without were walkes and alleys dight<br />
With divers trees enrang’d in even rankes;<br />
And here and there were pleasant arbors pight,<br />
And shadie seates and sundry flowring bankes,<br />
To sit and rest the walker’s wearie shankes.”</p>

<p class="p1">Yes; it is obviously to these grounds and gardens that reference is made
in the “Arcadia:”&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“There were hilles which garnished their proud heights with stately trees; humble
vallies whose base estate seemed comforted with refreshing of silver rivers; medowes
enamel with all sortes of eypleasing floures; thickets, which, being lined with most
pleasant shade, were witnessed so too, by the cheerfull disposition of many well-tuned
birds; each pasture stored with sheepe feeding with sober securitie, while the pretie
lambes with bleating oratorie craved the dams’ comfort; here a shepheard’s boy piping as
though he should neuer be old; there a young shepherdesse knitting and withall singing;
and it seemed that her voice comforted her hands to worke, and her hands kept time to her
voice’s musick.”</p>

<p class="p1">It is to-day as it was so long ago&mdash;when the sweetest of all the singers
and the most heroic of all the cavaliers of old times had their healthy walks
through these woods, and their poetic “talks” under the branches of these
patrician trees&mdash;old then, and very old now. Truly Wilton is “a place for
pleasantnesse,” and “not unfit for solitarinesse.”</p>

<p>“Gloriana”&mdash;Queen Elizabeth&mdash;did certainly visit this “chosen plot of
fertile land;” partook of “a very fair and pleasant banquet” in this park;
and from Wilton she carried away many rich gifts, including “a mermaid of
gold, having a maid upon her back garnished with sparks of diamonds.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1236" id="Page_1236">[1236]</a></span></p>

<p>From a queen to a man of genius, who was a good man, is not a long
leap. What visitor to Wilton will forget the name of that George Herbert
who was the humble and faithful servant of God&mdash;who did His work in this
locality, and who, while he threw a line across the glistening Nadder (for
he was the disciple as well as the friend of Izaak Walton), here wove those
fancies into verse which after ages have not suffered to die?</p>

<p>And surely we may well close our notes on Wilton by quoting good old
Izaak’s summary of the character of Lord Edward Herbert:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“He was one of the handsomest men of his day, of a beauty alike stately, chivalric, and
intellectual. His person and features were cultivated by all the disciplines of a time when
courtly graces were not insignificant, because a monarch-mind informed the court, nor
warlike customs rude or mechanical, for industrial nature had free play in the field, except
as restrained by the laws of courtesy and honour. The steel glove became his hand, and
the spur his heel; neither can we fancy him out of his place, for any place he would have
made his own.”</p>

<p class="p1">There is yet another of the worthies of Wilton to claim and receive the
homage of every visitor&mdash;the Right Hon. Sidney Herbert, created Lord
Herbert of Lea before his premature death. He did not outlive his brother,
the Earl, but his son inherited the titles and estates, and is now, as we have
stated, the thirteenth Earl of Pembroke.</p>

<p>There is a statue of Sidney Herbert, by Marochetti, in the Market-place
at Salisbury; and a far better statue of him, by Foley, fronts the War
Office in Pall Mall: it honours him as the Secretary of War, and makes
record of some of his triumphs as the gentle and genial advocate of peace
and Christian charity to all mankind. “Sidney Herbert,” says Mr. Hall,
who was associated with him as one of the Honorary Secretaries of
the Nightingale Fund, “seemed to me a copy, and without an atom
deteriorated, of his renowned relative-predecessor, Lord Herbert of
Cherbury. He lived in another age, and had to discharge very different
duties; but there was the same heroic sentiment, the same high chivalry,
the same generous sympathy with suffering, the same stern and steady
resolve to right the wrong. It is not too much to say that what we may
have imagined of the chivalry of a past age we have witnessed in our own:
a gentleman who gave dignity to the loftiest rank; who thought it no condescension
to be kind and courteous to the very humblest who approached
him. To rare personal advantages he added those of large intellectual
acquirements. He spoke, if not as an orator, with impressive eloquence; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1237" id="Page_1237">[1237]</a></span>
a man of practical business, few were his superiors; he had the mind of a
statesman, yet gave earnest and thoughtful care to all the minor details of
life. His death was a public calamity.”</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The New Church at Wilton.</i></p>
</div>

<p>No one who visits Wilton&mdash;either the town or the mansion&mdash;will leave
it without seeing and examining “the New Church,” of which we give
an engraving. It was erected in 1844, at the cost of Sidney Herbert, the
architects being F. H. Wyatt and D. Brandon. The style, as will be
perceived, is that of the ordinary Romanesque. It is a singularly beautiful
and very gorgeous structure, built without regard to expense: perhaps
there is nothing more perfect, of its class, in the kingdom. The following
details from a local newspaper give a technical description of this
edifice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The church is raised on a terrace with a noble flight of steps 100 feet long, and a
platform 20 feet in width. The centre entrance of the east front forms an open-recessed
porch within a rich archway, which contains four columns on each side. Over this centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1238" id="Page_1238">[1238]</a></span>
entrance is a series of small circular-headed arches, forming a sort of exterior gallery at
the back of the one within, and producing a good deal of relief and richness. Immediately
above it is a very large rose window, of elaborate design, set within a square, whose
spandrils are sculptured with the emblems of the four evangelists. The lofty campanile
tower is connected with the south-east angle of the building by a vestibule or cloister,
whose elaborately carved open arches and columns present a pleasing contrast to the
breadth and solidity of the other parts. On the same side of the church, at the west end,
is a projecting porch (or vestry), which naturally increases the play and picturesqueness of
the composition. Upon entering the rich door in the east front, already described, we pass
between two screens of twisted columns, dividing the gallery staircase from the centre
porch. Immediately opposite to this entrance is placed the font, a massive structure of
black and variegated Italian marble. It is carved with lions’ heads at the corners, and
the basin is richly foliated. The pedestal is of white marble in panels, inlaid with vine-leaves
in black marble. The whole is raised on a black marble plinth.... The pulpit
is of stone, inlaid with panels of marble, and glittering with rich mosaic-work, having also
four twisted columns wholly composed of ancient mosaic, and supported by the black
marble columns with alabaster capitals. The roofing of the nave and aisles is of open
timber-work, stained to imitate dark chestnut.... The height of the campanile is
100 feet; and in it are hung a peal of six bells, brought from the old church. The
remaining dimensions are as under: from the western porch to the chancel apse, 120 feet;
width, 53 feet; width of nave between the columns, 24 feet; height, 57 feet; aisles, 13 feet
wide, and 24 feet high.”</p>

<p class="p1">One of the most interesting places in Wilton is the famous “Royal
Axminster and Wilton Carpet Factory” of Messrs. Yates and Co., and this,
through the courtesy of the proprietors, may be seen by visitors to this
district. This manufactory, which occupies nearly two acres of ground and
gives employment to nearly four hundred people, was the first place in
England where carpets were made. A charter was granted in 1701, and
other charters of 1706 and 1725 (by which the weavers were made a
corporate body, with stewards, &amp;c.) were also granted. By these all persons
who were not members of the body of weavers were prevented from
carrying on the same business within three miles of the borough of Wilton,
stamped certificates, after seven years’ apprenticeship, being given by the
corporation to such men as were elected by them. The carpets then made
were naturally of a coarse and very inferior character to those produced
after on. To Henry, ninth Earl of Pembroke and sixth Earl of Montgomery,
of whom we have spoken in a preceding page, and who died in
1751, England is indebted for the introduction of the manufacture of
superior descriptions of carpets. Like many of his ancestors, he was a
man of refined taste, and spent large sums of money in adorning his mansion
at Wilton. Lord Orford says of him, “The soul of Inigo Jones, who
had been patronised by his ancestors, seems still to hover over its favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1239" id="Page_1239">[1239]</a></span>
Wilton, and to have assisted the muses of Art in the education of this
noble person. The towers, the chambers, the scenes which Holbein, Jones,
and Vandyke decorated, and which Earl Thomas had enriched with the
spoil of the best ages, received the last touches of beauty from Earl Henry’s
hand.” The Earl during his travels in Flanders and France had taken
great interest in the carpet works of those countries, and he noticed the
much more general use of this article of furniture there than in England,
where it was then regarded as an exotic luxury, and the idea occurred to
him that the manufacture might be established in England, so as to form
a new industry, and be a source of employment to the poor. He therefore
entered into arrangements with artists, superintendents, and a body of
workmen; brought them to England about the year 1745; and settled them
in Wilton&mdash;thus laying the foundation of that branch of manufacture which
now in England surpasses by far that of any other country.</p>

<p>The productions of this famous historical factory, to which, years ago, the
looms and trade from Axminster were transferred, are entirely hand-made,
and in this particular the manufactory is the only one in existence in this
kingdom. Carpets of various degrees of quality and of different descriptions
are here made, but whether “Brussels,” “Saxony,” “Velvet-pile,”
“Axminster,” or what not, all are “real hand-made,” and all of extreme
excellence, both in design and in superiority of make. “Royal carpets”
for Windsor Castle, for Buckingham Palace, and other abodes of royalty,
may now and then be seen by the visitor in course of weaving, and many
of these better-class carpets, which are an inch or more in thickness, and
of the softness of down to the tread, are of the most gorgeous character in
design and in brilliancy and arrangement of colours. A “Wilton carpet”
indicates a high degree of refinement in furnishing, and its enduring
quality gives it a strong recommendation.</p>

<p>Wilton House is within three miles of venerable Salisbury, six miles
or so from Stonehenge, and some three or four miles from “Old Sarum;”
the visitor may, therefore, with but little sacrifice of time, examine three of
the most interesting of all the relics of ancient England, while Wilton itself
may well be ranked as a fourth.</p>

<p>If we have cathedrals grander, more extensive, and more magnificent
than that of Salisbury, we have none more graceful: “the singular
uniformity displayed in its design and style, the harmony which pervades
its several parts and proportions, and the striking air of brightness,
simplicity, and elegance, that reigns throughout the whole, all conspire to
invest it with a charm peculiarly its own; whilst the great elevation of its
graceful spire renders it without exception the most lofty building in the
kingdom.” Grace is, indeed, its especial attribute, and beauty has not been
here “a fatal gift;” for the sacred edifice seems as perfect to-day as it was
many centuries ago.</p>

<p>Stonehenge is near at hand; that wonderful assemblage of stones
which tell us&mdash;nothing, defying even the guess-work of the antiquary,
concerning which tradition is dumb; yet there they stand as they stood
thousands of years ago, solitary in their solemn grandeur upon the plain
where the grouse and hares are even now their only neighbours.</p>

<p>“Old Sarum” seems but a huge waste heap: it rises high above environing
scenery; there are no dwellings on the “mound”&mdash;not even one where
might have been registered the return to Parliament of the member by
whom it was represented, until Reform arrested its chronicles, and swept
it away as a city for ever.</p>

</div>
<p class="dc13 p4">FEW counties are so rich in ancient fortresses and castellated
buildings as Durham; but pre-eminent among these in historical
interest, and perhaps in antiquity, is Raby Castle, which we add
to our series. Situate about six or seven miles from Barnard
Castle, a trifle more than that from Bishop Auckland, and about a
dozen from Darlington, Raby Castle, with its grand old park, lies
close to the pretty little town of Staindrop, about which we shall say
a few words later on. The castle itself, with its many massive towers and
turrets, is built on rising ground, on a foundation of solid rock, and is
surrounded and enclosed by a massive battlemented wall, the area of the
edifice, within the wall, comprising about two acres of land. The
castle was formerly surrounded by a moat, the course of which, although
now filled up, is clearly traceable; in its place extensive sheets of ornamental
water have been very judiciously laid out, and give to the scene
the effect, in approaching the castle from the park, of a fine but placid
river.</p>

<p>Raby Park, which surrounds the castle, consists of several hundred
acres of the finest land, and contains a noble herd of more than five
hundred red and fallow deer. The park is entered by three Lodges of
ancient and unpretentious appearance. The South Lodge, which is the
main entrance, is situated about one hundred yards from Staindrop Church.
On entering the Lodge, within a very short distance from here the towers
of the castle are visible, and continue in sight for some considerable
distance, when a sharp incline cuts off the view. On attaining the summit
the grand old pile is again seen standing boldly out from the grounds, and
forming a most imposing prospect, which is greatly enhanced by the sheet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1243" id="Page_1243">[1243]</a></span>
of water that at this point separates the castle from the observer. The
carriage drive from the Lodge has hitherto been wavy and circuitous in
its route, but from here it takes a straight course across the Pond, or Lake,
of ten acres in extent, by means of an embankment, and again continues
in a circuitous form through an avenue of grand old venerable beech-trees,
which terminates at the entrance, or Porter’s Lodge, to the castle itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-b243.jpg" width="400" height="312" id="b243"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>South Side.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Pond, or Lake, which is divided by the carriage drive, is situated
on the west side of the castle, its western portion overflowing into the
eastern half, that flows to and surrounds the south battlement walls; the
Moat, which is now dry, receding from it to the east and west. The Lake
is well supplied with swans and other aquatic birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1244" id="Page_1244">[1244]</a></span></p>

<p>The East Lodge is a foot entrance for the workpeople; the North Lodge,
or back entrance, has two low castellated towers, one on each side of the
entrance gates.</p>

<p>The Home Park and Woods consist of nine hundred and forty acres,
which are intersected by fifteen miles of drives and walks. The Woods are
beautifully varied and picturesque, especially the North Wood, which forms
the north boundary of the park, and rises considerably above the castle,
commanding a most extensive and charming landscape, especially on a
clear sunset evening, when the old dark walls of the castle are lit up by
its golden rays, which are also reflected on the far-distant Yorkshire and
Richmond hills.</p>

<p>The Bath Wood, which is quite of a different nature from the North
Wood, is situated a short distance to the west of the castle in a valley
that is thickly wooded, and through which walks and drives wind their
way in such varied forms as to render it one of the most enjoyable summer
retreats that can possibly be desired. The walks and drives all terminate
at the Bath-house, somewhat west of the centre of the wood. In front
of the Bath, which consists of two rooms, supplied by a natural spring
of intensely cold water, is a fine open lawn, well laid out with rhododendron
beds and single specimens of conifers, with a lake-stream of water winding
its way in various falls and artificial forms. This open space, or lawn, is
thickly surrounded with grand old beech and spruce-fir trees, blending
most charmingly together. At the back and on the north side of the Bath-house
is a picturesquely built lodge or cottage, inhabited by persons who
have charge of the Baths.</p>

<p>The Gardens are situated on the north side of the castle, on a
slight incline, which commands some of the most interesting views of
the north side of the building. The whole grounds pertaining to the
Gardens, including the head and under gardeners’ dwellings, are enclosed
within substantial time-worn brick walls, which are strictly in keeping with
the castle itself. The interior is formed into various sections by brick walls
and massive yew hedges, that are kept closely clipped in tapering
form; in measure they are ten feet wide, and eleven feet high, and
probably were planted in the days of the first occupiers of the castle.
Formerly these sections were almost exclusively devoted to the culture of
fruit and vegetables, but of late years bedding plants of all descriptions
have been extensively introduced, associating very agreeably the ornamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1245" id="Page_1245">[1245]</a></span>
with the useful. On a terrace which is bounded on one side by
a stream of water is a ribbon border extending its whole length; and
on the south side of the boundary wall the effect produced by the bends
and receding form of the border is very charming, and the perfection
of what a ribbon border should be. Glass structures are extensive, and
principally devoted to fruit culture, especially to pines and grapes. Excepting
the Conservatory and two or three other houses containing some very
fine specimens of tropical plants, plant culture is little regarded. Most
of these houses have been reconstructed on the most approved modern
principles, but they are scattered about in all directions. The noble range
of vineries erected some thirty years since, that contained the vines which
caused so much controversy amongst horticulturists on the carrion system
of vine culture, are now things of the past, and are succeeded by fine
healthy canes, which must, to all present appearance, produce in the future
fruit of the most approved excellence. In addition to the many glass
structures devoted to fruit culture, hot-air walls are also introduced for the
same purpose, which, especially in the case of apricots, insure a full crop
in spite of unpropitious weather.</p>

<p>The most-cared-for antique occupant in the Garden is, however, the
famous “Raby Fig-tree,” which, although known to be upwards of one
hundred years old, still produces annually thousands of figs of the finest
quality. This remarkable tree is covered by a primitive glass structure,
very much in keeping with its own venerable character. The house in
which the tree is planted is fifty feet in length, eight feet in width,
and nearly twelve feet in height; and every possible space of this house,
both walls and rafters, is occupied by this one tree, which bids fair to
live and flourish and produce fruit for many a century yet to come. The
house is heated by flues. Another speciality of the Gardens is the original
“Raby Red Currant,” whose trees are still in as good preservation, as
prolific, and as much in repute as ever.</p>

<p>The name of Raby points to a Danish origin, and it is first named,
so far as any record is known, in connection with King Canute, who, after
making his celebrated pilgrimage over Garmondsway Moor to the shrine
of St. Cuthbert at Durham, offered it, with Staindrop and its shire, to the
shrine of that saint. It continued, except for a time during the life of
Bishop Flambard, in the peaceful possession of the monks until 1131, when
they granted it, for an annual rent of £4, to Dolfin, son of Ughtred, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1246" id="Page_1246">[1246]</a></span>
the blood royal of Northumberland.</p>

</div>

<p>To him, Mr. Hodgson is of opinion,
is to be ascribed the first foundation of the manor. The descendant of
Dolfin, Robert Fitz-Maldred, lineal heir to Ughtred, Earl of Northumberland,
was described as “Dominus de Raby,” when, early in the thirteenth
century, he married Isabel de Nevil (daughter to Geoffrey de Nevil, the
grandson of Gilbert de Nevil, who came over with the Conqueror, by the
daughter and sole heiress of Bertram de Bulmer), who, by the death of
her brother, the last male of his line, became sole heiress and representative
of the great Saxon house of Bulmer, Lords of Brancepath and Sheriff-Hutton.
Their son Geoffrey assumed his mother’s surname of Nevil,
and thus laid afresh the foundation of the great house of that name. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1247" id="Page_1247">[1247]</a></span>
had issue two sons&mdash;Robert, who succeeded him, and Geoffrey, who became
Constable of Scarborough Castle and Justice Itinerant, and from whom
the Nevils of Hornby, afterwards merged in the Beauforts, descended.
Robert de Nevil, who was Governor of Norham, Werke, York, Devizes,
and Bamborough Castles, Warden of all the King’s forests north of the
Trent, Justice Itinerant, General of all forces beyond the Trent, and Sheriff
of Yorkshire, joined the rebellious barons, but was afterwards restored
to favour. His son Robert, called the “Peacock of the North,” dying
without issue during his lifetime, this elder Robert was succeeded by
Ralph de Nevil, who took a prominent part in the troublous internal wars
of his time. He in turn was succeeded by his son, John de Nevil, Baron
of Raby, who was Admiral of the King’s fleet from the Thames northward,
Warden of the East Marches, Lieutenant of the Duchy of Aquitaine, and
Seneschal of Bordeaux. He died 12th Richard II., and was succeeded
by his eldest son, Ralph, his second son being Thomas, Lord Furnival.
This John, Lord Nevil, was the builder of the present castle of Raby.</p>

<p>Ralph, Lord Nevil of Raby, held many important offices, and founded
the collegiate church of Staindrop. By his first wife, Margaret, daughter
of Hugh, Earl of Stafford, he had issue two sons&mdash;John, who died during
his father’s lifetime, and Ralph, “who married the daughter and heir of
Ferrers of Oversley, by whom he had John Nevil, called Lord Ferrers,
whose daughter Joan (heir to the baronies of Oversley and Newmarch),
being married to Sir William Gascoigne, brought forth Margaret Gascoigne,
their daughter and heir, wife to Wentworth; whence the Barons Raby
of that surname do descend”&mdash;and seven daughters: Maud, married to
Baron de Mauley; Alice, to Sir Thomas Grey; Philippa, to Baron Dacres
of Gillesland; Margaret, to Baron Scrope; Anne, to Sir Gilbert de Umfraville;
Margery and Elizabeth, nuns. His second wife was Joan, daughter
of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, “by whom he had issue eight sons&mdash;Richard,
Earl of Salisbury; William, Baron Falconberg; George, Baron
Latimer; Edward, Baron Bergavenny; Robert, Bishop of Durham; Cuthbert,
Henry, and Thomas, which three last died issueless. Also five
daughters&mdash;Catherine, married first to John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
secondly to Thomas Strangways, Esq., thirdly to John, Viscount Beaumont,
and lastly to Sir John Widville, Knight; Eleanor, or Elizabeth, to Richard,
Baron Spencer, secondly to Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland; Anne,
to Humphrey, Duke of Bucks, and afterwards to Walter Blunt, Baron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1248" id="Page_1248">[1248]</a></span>
Mountjoy; Jane, a nun; and Ciceley, to Richard Plantagenet, Duke of
York.” He was created Earl of Westmoreland, being “the first who was
made earl of this county;” and at his death, in the 4th of Henry VI.,
he was succeeded by his grandson, Ralph Nevil, as second Earl of Westmoreland
and Baron Nevil of Raby, who in turn was succeeded by his
cousin, Ralph Nevil, son to Sir John Nevil, as third Earl of Westmoreland.
He married Margaret, daughter of Sir Roger Booth, by whom he had issue,
with others, one son, who died in his father’s lifetime, leaving a son, Ralph,
who in turn succeeded his grandfather.</p>

<p>Ralph, fourth Earl of Westmoreland and Baron Nevil of Raby, married
Catherine, daughter of Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckinghamshire, by
whom he had issue seven sons and five daughters, and was, at his death,
succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Nevil, as fifth earl. This earl married
Anne, daughter to Thomas Manners, Earl of Rutland, by whom, amongst
others, he had issue a son, Charles, who succeeded him as fifth Earl of
Westmoreland and Baron Nevil of Raby.</p>

<p>This nobleman, Charles, fifth Earl of Westmoreland, having taken an
active part in the rebellion against Queen Elizabeth, known as the “Rising
in the North,” was defeated, and all his possessions confiscated to the
Crown. He left only female issue.</p>

<p>Raby, having passed into the hands of the Crown, was afterwards sold to
the Vanes, to which family we now draw attention.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that Raby Castle holds a very high rank among the
ancient castles of England, and is one of the few of its old glories that
continue to be the habitation of its lords.</p>

<p>The family of Vane, of which the Duke of Cleveland, the owner of Raby
Castle, is the head, is of very high antiquity, and, unlike many of our noted
families, has been continued in unbroken succession from at least the time
of the Norman Conquest down to the present hour. The first of whom we
have any authentic record&mdash;although doubtless the family might be traced
much further back still&mdash;is Howell ap Vane, who was living in Monmouthshire
antecedently to the Conquest. His son, Griffith ap Howell Vane, married
Lettyce, daughter of Bledwyn ap Kynvyn, Lord of Powys, who was founder
of three noble tribes of Wales, and by usurpation sovereign of North and
South Wales. Their son was Enyon, or Ivon, “the Fair,” who married
a daughter of Owen ap Edwyn Meredith. Passing on through the next
three generations, we come to Sir Henry Vane, knighted at the battle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1249" id="Page_1249">[1249]</a></span>
Poitiers, in 1356, where he claimed to have assisted in taking prisoner
John, King of France, who, in token of his captivity, took off his dexter
gauntlet and gave it to Vane: from that moment he adopted it as his
cognisance, and it has been continued both as a crest and as a charge on
the shield of arms.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>South and East Sides.</i></p>
</div>

<p>He married Grace, daughter of Sir Stephen de la Leke,
and was succeeded by his son, John Vane, whose great-grandson, Henry
Vane (his elder brother having died without issue), married Isabella,
daughter of Henry Persall, or Peshall, by whom he had a family of eight
sons and two daughters, and, in default of issue of the eldest two, was
succeeded by his third son, John Vane (whose younger brother, Sir Ralph
Vane, married Elizabeth, known as “the good Lady Vane,” and was
knighted at the siege of Bulleyn, in 1544; he afterwards purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1250" id="Page_1250">[1250]</a></span>
Penshurst, was attainted 4th Edward VI., executed on Tower Hill, and his
estates forfeited). John Vane, who was of Hilden, in Kent, assumed the
name of Fane in lieu of Vane, and married Isabella, daughter of John
Darknoll, or Darrell, and was succeeded by their second son, Richard Fane,
of Tudeley, at whose death, in 1540, he was succeeded by his only son,
George Fane, of Badsall, who married Joan, daughter of William Waller,
of Groombridge, from whom the present Earl of Westmoreland is descended.
The fourth son of John Vane, or Fane, of Hilden, was John Fane, who was
in possession of Hadlow when his uncle, Sir Ralph, was executed. He
married Joan, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Edward Hawte, of Tonbridge,
by whom, with others, he had a son, his successor, Henry Fane, of Hadlow,
who took part in Wyatt’s insurrection, was committed to the Tower, but
afterwards pardoned and released.</p>

<p>His grandson, Sir Henry Fane, resumed the ancient patronymic of his
family, Vane, in lieu of Fane, and this has continued to the present time.
This Henry Fane, or Vane, was knighted in 1611, and was constituted one
of the regents of the kingdom for the safe keeping of the Queen, Prince
Charles, and the rest of the royal children. In 1616, on the disgrace of
Robert Carr of Fernyhurst, Earl of Somerset, Sir Henry Vane received a lease
from the trustees for support of the household of Charles, Prince of Wales,
for the remainder of the term granted to Carr. He was principal Secretary
of State to James I., and Cofferer of the Household to Charles I. In 1626
he purchased the castle and manor of Raby, and in 1632 was sent as
ambassador to Sweden to expostulate with Gustavus Adolphus in favour of
the Elector Palatine. In the following year he nobly entertained the King
at Raby, on his journey to and from Scotland, on the occasion of his
coronation. He married Frances, daughter of Thomas Darcy, of Tolleshunt
Darcy, and died at Raby Castle in 1654. By this union he had seven
sons&mdash;viz. Thomas and John, who died in infancy; Sir Henry Vane, who
succeeded him; and Sir George Vane, from whom the Marquis of Londonderry,
who sits as Earl Vane, is descended; Sir Walter Vane, Charles
Vane, and William Vane&mdash;and eight daughters, among whom were Margaret,
married to Sir Thomas Pelham, from whom are descended the Duke of
Newcastle and the Earl of Chichester; and Frances, wife of Sir Robert
Honeywood.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Vane (third son), who succeeded his father in the estates
of Raby, Fairlawn, Shipborne, &amp;c., in 1654, had a very chequered, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1251" id="Page_1251">[1251]</a></span>
historical life. He was educated at Westminster and Oxford, proceeded to
Geneva, and afterwards to America, where he was elected Governor of
Massachusetts. He was also M.P. for Hull and other places, and was
knighted in 1640. He is characterized as “one of the most turbulent
enthusiasts produced by the rebellion, and an inflexible Republican,” by
some, but by Milton as</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Vane, young in years, but in sage counsel old.”</p>

<p class="pn1">In 1659 he was, in Pepys’s own words, “this day voted out of the House,
and to sit no more there; and that he would retire himself to his house at
Raby.” And again, a month later, “This day, by an order of the House,
Sir H. Vane was sent out of town to his house in Lincolnshire.” In 1661
he, with Lambert and others, was sent prisoner to Scilly. He had in
former years been joined with Sir William Russell in the office of Treasurer
of the Navy, which yielded an annual income of £30,000; but although,
as survivor of Russell, the whole of this was his by patent for life, he
voluntarily and disinterestedly gave it up to Parliament, reserving only a
salary of £2,000 a year for an agent. A series of charges having been
drawn up against Vane&mdash;principally arising out of his just indignation
at the title of Raby having been bestowed upon the Earl of Strafford&mdash;he
was, on the 6th of June, 1662, found guilty of high treason,
and, on the 14th of the same month, beheaded on Tower Hill. Of this
execution it is needless to give any particulars beyond those written, the
same day, by Pepys. He says, “Up by four o’clock in the morning
and upon business at my office. Then we sat down to business, and about
eleven o’clock, having a room got ready for us, we all went out to the
Tower Hill; and there over against the scaffold, made on purpose this day,
saw Sir Henry Vane brought. A very great press of people. He made a
long speech, many times interrupted by the sheriffe and others there; and
they would have taken his paper out of his hand, but he would not let it go.
But they caused all the books of those that writ after him to be given the
sheriffe; and the trumpets were brought under the scaffold that he might
not be heard. Then he prayed and so fitted himself, and received the blow;
but the scaffold was so crowded that we could not see it done. But Boreman,
who had been upon the scaffold, came to us and told us, that first he began
to speak of the irregular proceeding against him; that he was, against
Magna Charta, denied to have his exceptions against the indictment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1252" id="Page_1252">[1252]</a></span>
allowed: and that there he was stopped by the sheriffe. Then he drew
out his paper of notes, and began to tell them first his life; that he was born
a gentleman, that he was bred up and had the quality of a gentleman, and
to make him in the opinion of the world more a gentleman, he had been till
he was seventeen years old a good fellow, but then it pleased God to lay a
foundation of grace in his heart by which he was persuaded, against his
worldly interest, to leave all preferment and go abroad, where he might
serve God with more freedom. Then he was called home and made a
member of the Long Parliament, where he never did to this day anything
against his conscience, but all for the glory of God. Here he would have
given them an account of the proceedings of the Long Parliament, but they
so often interrupted him that at last he was forced to give over, and so fell
into prayer for England in generall, then for the churches of England, and
then for the City of London: and so fitted himself for the block, and
received the blow. He had a blister, or issue, upon his neck, which he
desired them not hurt: he changed not his colour or speech to the last, but
died justifying himself and the cause he had stood for; and spake very
confidently of his being presently at the right hand of Christ; and in all
things appeared the most resolved man that ever died in that manner, and
showed more of heate than cowardice, but yet with all humility and gravity.
One asked him why he did not pray for the King? He answered, ‘Nay,’
says he, ‘you shall see I can pray for the King: I pray God bless him!’
The King had given his body to his friends, and, therefore, he told them
that he hoped they would be civil to his body when dead; and desired they
would let him die like a gentleman and a Christian, and not crowded and
pressed as he was.”</p>

<p>This unfortunate, but gifted member of the family of Vane had married,
in 1639, Frances, daughter of Sir Christopher Wray, Bart., of Ashby and
Glentworth, in Lincolnshire, by whom he had issue seven sons, five of
whom died young. The fifth son was Sir Christopher Vane, who was
knighted in 1688, made a Privy Councillor, and in July, 1699, created Baron
Barnard of Barnard Castle, county of Durham. He married Elizabeth,
eldest daughter of Gilbert Holles, third Earl of Clare, and sister of John
Holles, Duke of Newcastle. By her Baron Barnard had issue, with others,
a son&mdash;Gilbert Vane, who succeeded him; and another son&mdash;William Vane,
who was created Viscount Vane and Baron Duncannon. This Viscount
Vane married Lucy, daughter of William Jolliffe, Esq., of Caverswall, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1253" id="Page_1253">[1253]</a></span>
Staffordshire, and was father, by her, of William Holles Vane, second
Viscount, whose wife (Frances, daughter of Francis Hawes, of Purley Hall,
and widow of Lord William Hamilton) was the notorious Lady Vane, whose
intrigues and disreputable course of life form the subject of the “Memoirs
of a Lady of Quality” in “Peregrine Pickle,” which were “written by
herself, which she coolly told her lord to read.”</p>

<p>Gilbert Vane, second Baron Barnard, who succeeded his father, the first
baron, in 1723, and died in 1753, married Mary, daughter and heiress of
Morgan Randyll, of Chilworth, by whom he had six sons and three
daughters. His eldest son and successor was Henry, third Baron Barnard,
a Lord of the Treasury, who, in 1754, was advanced to the dignity of
Viscount Barnard and Earl of Darlington. This nobleman, of whom Lord
Orford wrote, “He never said a false thing nor did a bad one,” married,
in 1725, the Lady Grace, daughter of Charles Fitzroy, first Duke of Cleveland,
by whom he had issue three sons and three daughters. The eldest son
was Lord Henry Vane, who succeeded his father as second Earl of Darlington
and fourth Baron Barnard; he married Margaret, sister of the first Earl of
Lonsdale; and, dying in 1792, was succeeded by their eldest son, William
Henry, as fifth baron and third earl.</p>

<p>This nobleman, who held many important appointments, was born in
1766; in 1827 he was advanced to the dignity of Marquis of Cleveland;
and in 1833 was again advanced to the title of Duke of Cleveland, and had
the barony of Raby conferred upon him. He was married twice: first, in
1787, to the Lady Katharine Margaretta Powlett, daughter and co-heiress
of the sixth and last Duke of Bolton, and a co-heiress of the barony of
St. John of Basing; and secondly, in 1813, to Elizabeth Russell, of Newton
House, Yorkshire. By his first marriage the Duke had issue three sons (who
have each in succession become Dukes of Cleveland) and five daughters&mdash;one
of whom, Lady Louisa Catherine Barbara, married a brother of the
first Lord Forester, and another, the Lady Arabella, married the third
Lord Alvanley. The Duke was succeeded at his death, in 1842, by his
eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry Vane, second duke and marquis, third earl and viscount, and
sixth baron, who was born in 1788, and died, without issue, in 1864, having
married, in 1809, Lady Sophia, daughter of the fourth Earl Powlett. He
was succeeded by his brother, William John Frederick Vane, as third duke
and marquis, fourth earl and viscount, and seventh baron, who assumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1254" id="Page_1254">[1254]</a></span>
the surname of Powlett in lieu of that of Vane, but in 1864 resumed his
original patronymic of Vane. His grace married, in 1815, Caroline, fourth
daughter of the first Earl of Lonsdale, but died without issue in 1864, when
he was in turn succeeded in his titles and estates by his brother, the present
Duke of Cleveland.</p>

<p>The present noble head of this grand old family, whose genealogy we
have thus briefly traced, is Harry George Powlett (late Vane), Duke of
Cleveland, Marquis of Cleveland, Earl of Darlington, Viscount Barnard of
Barnard Castle, Baron Barnard, and Baron Raby, a Knight of the Garter,
&amp;c. His grace is, as has been shown, a son of the first Duke of Cleveland,
and brother of the second and third dukes. He was born in 1803, and
succeeded to the titles and estates in 1864, when, by royal license, he
assumed the surname and arms of Powlett in lieu of those of Vane. His
grace, who was educated at Eton and at Oriel College, Oxford, was attached
to the embassy at Paris in 1829, and was appointed Secretary of Legation
at Stockholm in 1839. In 1854 he married Lady Catherine Lucy Wilhelmina
Stanhope, daughter of the late Earl Stanhope (President of the
Society of Antiquaries), and widow of Lord Dalmeny, son of the Earl of
Rosebery, by whom, however, he has no issue, so that at his decease&mdash;his
brothers, the second and third dukes, having also died without issue&mdash;the
titles, with the exception of that of Baron Barnard, will become extinct.
The heir to the barony of Barnard is Morgan Vane, Esq. (only son of the
late Rev. Robert Morgan Vane), great-grandson of the Hon. Morgan
Vane, brother of Henry, third Baron Barnard, who, as we have shown,
was created Viscount Barnard and Earl of Darlington. This Robert
Morgan Vane married, as his first wife, Margaretta, daughter of Robert
Knight, and ultimately heiress to Robert, Earl of Catherlough, from which
marriage the present heir-presumptive is descended.</p>

<p>The arms of Vane are (as already explained, from the circumstance of
one of the family taking the French king prisoner at the battle of Poitiers)&mdash;<i>azure</i>,
three dexter gauntlets, <i>or</i>. These were borne by the Duke of
Cleveland quarterly with those of Fitzroy, being the royal arms of King
Charles II., viz.&mdash;one and four France and England quarterly, two Ireland,
three Scotland; the whole debruised by a baton sinister, componé of six
pieces, <i>ermine</i> and <i>azure</i>, the supporters being dexter, a lion guardant, <i>or</i>,
ducally crowned with a ducal coronet, <i>azure</i>, gorged with a collar counter-componé,
<i>ermine</i> and <i>azure</i>; sinister, a greyhound, <i>argent</i>, gorged with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1255" id="Page_1255">[1255]</a></span>
collar, counter-componé, <i>ermine</i> and <i>azure</i>, being the supporters of Fitzroy,
Duke of Cleveland, granted to Vane on being advanced to the marquisate in
1827. Crests: Vane&mdash;a dexter arm in a gauntlet grasping a dagger;
Fitzroy&mdash;on a chapeau, <i>gules</i>, turned up, <i>ermine</i>, a lion passant guardant, <i>or</i>,
crowned with a ducal coronet, <i>argent</i>, and gorged with a collar, counter-componé,
<i>ermine</i> and <i>azure</i>. Motto&mdash;“Nec temere, nec timide.” On the
assumption of the name and arms of Powlett, the arms, as now borne by
the Duke of Cleveland, are&mdash;<i>sable</i>, three swords in pile, points downwards,
<i>proper</i>, pomels and hilts, <i>or</i>. Crest, on a wreath, a falcon rising, <i>or</i>, belled
of the last, and ducally crowned, <i>gules</i>. Supporters and motto as before.
The arms of the Earl of Catherlough, which the heir-presumptive is entitled
to quarter with his own of Vane, are&mdash;<i>argent</i>, three bendlets, <i>gules</i>; on a
canton, <i>azure</i>, a spur with the rowel downwards, strapped, <i>or</i>. Crest, on a
wreath, <i>argent</i> and <i>gules</i>, a spur, <i>or</i>, between two wings erect, <i>gules</i>. Motto&mdash;“Te
digna sequere.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Cleveland is patron of twenty-four livings, thirteen of which
are in Shropshire, one in Northamptonshire, two in Durham, two in
Somersetshire, one in Yorkshire, two in Devonshire, two in Dorset, and one
in Cornwall. His principal seats are Raby Castle, Durham, and Battle
Abbey, Sussex.</p>

<p>The present castle of Raby, it would appear, was built by John, Lord
Nevil, who died in 1388. In 1379 he had license from Thomas Hatfield,
Bishop of Durham, to crenellate. Whether the old castle was mainly
pulled down and rebuilt by John Nevil, or whether he simply added to
it fresh towers and fortifications, is a matter we have not space, nor is it
necessary to our purpose, to inquire into. That it could not all have been
taken down is, however, pretty evident, as the lozenge-shaped tower in
the centre is said to have been built by Bertram de Bulmer, or Bolemes,
in 1162. The Nevils, who were at the same time Lords of Raby, Brancepath,
Sheriff-Hutton, and Middleham, were all described as “Dominus de
Raby;” and thus it is evident that Raby was their chief residence and
stronghold.</p>

<p>Raby, says the Rev. Mr. Hodgson (who has done more than any other
antiquary in searching into and elucidating the history of this grand old
pile, and to whom we express our deep obligation for much of the critical
description of the building we are about to give), in its present state
(although some parts of the older edifice were left and incorporated in it)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1256" id="Page_1256">[1256]</a></span>
“presents essentially the work and ideas of one period,” the fourteenth
century. Leland speaks of it as “the largest castell of logginges in al the
north cuntrey, and is of a strong building, but not set other on the hill or
very strong ground;” but he does not mention the moat, which was probably
filled up and the water drawn off before his time.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>East Side.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The general arrangement of the castle is as follows:&mdash;First, the central
nucleus, or castle proper, consisting of a compact mass of towers connected
by short curtains, and of which the block shape may be described as something
between a right-angled triangle and a square, having the right angle
to the south-west. Next, a spacious platform entirely surrounding this
central mass; then a low embattled wall of enceinte, strengthened by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1257" id="Page_1257">[1257]</a></span>
moat-house, and perhaps a barbican, as well as by numerous small square
bastions rising from its exterior base; and then the moat. The south front
of the castle being so amply defended by water, its structural defences were
naturally less important.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>Raby Castle, from the West.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Quite unlike the others, it was, with the exception
of the flanking towers at either end, nearly flat. The first, or western
of these, called the Duke’s Tower, is very large and square, and of different
heights, being, in fact, two towers laid together. Considerably in recess,
a rather low curtain connected it with the end of the Great Hall, which,
till lately, rose up tower-like, but without projection. Beyond, and nearly
in a line, came another curtain, short, but lofty; and then the wedge-like
projection of Bulmer’s Tower, which flanked the whole towards the east.
This tower, which commemorates Bertram Bulmer, one of the Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1258" id="Page_1258">[1258]</a></span>
ancestors of the Nevils, by two raised B’s in its upper story, being of somewhat
unusual shape, viz. a pentagon, formed by the application of an
equilateral triangle to a square, has given rise to comments and conjectures
of the wildest sort. An underground passage, there is little or no doubt,
extends from the substructure of this tower to a small blocked-up doorway
in one of the bastions of the wall of enceinte above the lake, from which,
again, there is reason to think, another traverses its whole length westwards.
Passing onwards, we come to the east or north-east front. This is a very
fine work, extremely bold and vigorous, set thick with towers, and broken
by deep re-entering angles into immense masses. Thoroughly fortress-like
and utilitarian in its character, without the least pretence to ornament, it is
a masterpiece no less of artistic than constructive skill. Beginning at
the south-east angle, we have, in the first place, the great pentagon of
Bulmer’s Tower, and the short curtain spoken of as connecting it with the
Hall, standing out transept-wise from the latter, and defending it to the east.</p>

<p>A little farther on, and about midway in its length, the Chapel, with its
substructure terminating in a lofty tower, performs the same service. Projecting
from the lower part of this tower, until destroyed in modern times,
was an advanced portal, the exact nature of which cannot be particularised.
Again, at about an equal distance, a third transeptal mass, terminating
in a tower called Mount Raskelf, stands out from and protects the Hall.
A short high curtain, extending between the Chapel Tower and this last,
forms at the same time the limit of a small court-yard and a screen to that
portion of the Hall which lies behind it. Mount Raskelf is the angle tower
between what are, strictly speaking, the east and north fronts. Its northern
face and curtain fall back deeply till they join the great square of the
Kitchen Tower, which projects at right angles, and is connected by a strong
machicolated curtain to the east fabric of Clifford’s Tower, by far the
largest in the castle, and of immense strength. This tower is planned with
consummate skill. In shape an oblong square, standing almost detached,
and set diagonally to the north and west fronts, it not only completely flanks
them both, but also, from its close proximity to the Moat-house, could either
lend it effectual aid in case of an assault, or render it, if captured, utterly
untenable. Turning the angle of Clifford’s Tower, we gain the west front.
A strong machicolated curtain, bending slightly westward, connects it with
a lofty tower of slight projection, and separated by a short wall space from
the well-advanced and diagonally set turrets of the great Gatehouse. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1259" id="Page_1259">[1259]</a></span>
deep recess in the elevation intervenes between the latter and our starting-point,
the Duke’s Tower, which stands well out again, and terminates the
whole. Passing under the long vault of the great Gatehouse, we reach
the Court-yard. Lofty walls close it in on all sides with very picturesque
and fine effect, the Great Hall lying to the east. A central tower of beautiful
proportion, which stands out at right angles to it, shuts off a smaller
court-yard to the north. There are many points about the exterior which
require careful examination. First as to detail. What may be considered
the typical form of window is very characteristic and peculiar&mdash;a single
square-topped light, with a rounded trefoil in the head, the eye of which
is either sunk or pierced. It is very domestic, and has an excellent effect.
In Clifford’s Tower they are superimposed. The windows of the Chapel,
which, though good in themselves, are of an ordinary form, square-headed,
with net tracery, raise an important and interesting question, viz. What
is their probable date, and can we possibly assign them to what may fairly
be called the time of the builder of the great Gatehouse? Now the Chapel,
which is unquestionably the earliest part of the castle, and thoroughly
fortress-like in character, determines by its date the period when the general
work of reconstruction and fortifying began. In the Moat Tower, above
segmental, circular, and depressed four-centred arches, we have on the
summit concave, shoulder-arched doorways of wonderfully pure and early-looking
character. The side-windows of the Great Hall, again&mdash;pairs
of long lancets set closely together, and without hood-moulds&mdash;though
Transition or Early Perpendicular in date, are almost Early English in
composition. We need feel no very great surprise, therefore, if in the
Chapel we find a type adopted which was generally expiring. An examination
of the masonry on either hand of the great Gate Tower will show
that an extensive alteration was made in that part of the castle. It would
seem that the face of the original Gatehouse, which probably stood midway
between the back and front of the present one, just about where the inner
doorway spans the passage, was taken down, and the whole structure
brought forward as we see it. The roof proves this almost to demonstration.
Within the central archway, towards the Court-yard, it is a simple barrel
vault, strengthened with plain chamfered ribs. Without it, where the
passage-way widens, it is a well-moulded, beautiful lierne, the ribs producing,
perhaps intentionally, the Nevil saltire four times repeated. At
the same time the short curtain which connected the old Gatehouse with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1260" id="Page_1260">[1260]</a></span>
the tower to the north was advanced level with the face of the latter, and
the western half of the Duke’s Tower, already described as a double one,
added, so as to flank the front, which now, instead of having a salient angle
in the centre, as at first, was, so to say, made square. The outer entrance
of the Gatehouse is very fine. Its boldly moulded four-centred arch is
surmounted by a second of the same contour, but richly cusped and trefoiled.
Above it are three shields, each surrounded with the garter. They are&mdash;1st,
Nevil; 2nd, St. George; 3rd, Latimer; and fix certainly the erection
of this Gatehouse, though it looks so much later, between 1382&mdash;the
probable date of John Nevil’s second marriage with Elizabeth Latimer&mdash;and
his death in 1389.</p>

<p>Another most noticeable point about the work is the entire absence of
buttresses. Every tower and curtain stands in its own unaided strength.
The great diversities of design, especially as seen in the towers, should also
be noticed. Without the least approach to affectation or extravagance in
any, yet of all the nine included in the central group there are no two
which bear the faintest resemblance to each other&mdash;the variety and beauty of
proportion in its parts, and the admirable way in which they are combined,
producing, as they did once, a sky-line perhaps unmatched in England, are
really the glories of the castle. A perfect simplicity and directness of
purpose, with infinite change and play of line, characterize the building
throughout, and stamp it as the work of a master.</p>

<p>Modern alterations have so obscured and destroyed John Nevil’s work
in the interior that there is little of it left to see. Still there is something.
Leland, who mentions it, says, “The Haul and al the Houses of Offices
be large and stately. The Great Chaumber was exceeding large, but
now it is fals rofid and divided into two or three partes.” Now if by the
“Haul” and “Great Chaumber” he refers to the same thing, which internal
evidence seems to show he must, then the worthy itinerant was entirely
mistaken. “A recent investigation, accompanied by a vigorous use of the
pick, has shown me,” says Mr. Hodgson, “that the Hall, as its external
appearance indicates, was always, from the very first, a double one, consisting,
that is, of two halls of nearly equal height, one above the other.
About ten feet below the present floor I came upon the line of the old
one, which had been of wood carried on pillars (whence, perhaps, the
mistake of being ‘fals rofid’), the mutilated remains of the great fire-place,
and three doorways, all of which I partially opened out. The upper, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1261" id="Page_1261">[1261]</a></span>
Baron’s Hall, called so, perhaps, to distinguish it from the lower, was a
noble room. Ranges of long narrow transomed windows lighted it on each
side, as well as two large traceried ones of three lights to the south, and
another to the north. The roof, a very fine one of oak, was carried on
cambered beams, each displaying the saltire on its centre. These were the
ordinary arrangements. Extending the full width of the north end was
a lofty stone music gallery, with arch cornice. In advance of it the screens,
behind which, and leading to the Kitchen, Pantry, and Buttery, were once
most likely the usual three doorways, but of these, owing to mutilations, I
could only find one. At either end of the passage was a large arched
doorway. One of these opened upon a staircase close to the Chapel door,
the other upon the roof of a sort of cloister in the Great Court, which must
have formed a promenade, and of which also I have found the traces.
Platforms of this sort, carried on arches, and occupying an exactly similar
position, occur in the castles of Coucy and Creil.”</p>

<p>The Kitchen, though it has a certain air of rudeness, and has lost its
ancient fire-place, is still a very interesting relic, and one of the most perfect
things in the castle. It occupies the whole interior of a large strong square
tower. The windows, which have stepped sills, are set high up in the
walls, and are connected by a perforated passage of defence provided with
garde-robes, which runs all round. Two pairs of very strong vaulting ribs,
intersecting in the centre, carry the louvre, which is of stone and of immense
size. The lower part, twelve feet square, rises to upwards of the same
height above the leads, and is surmounted by an octagon fifteen feet higher
still. Externally it forms a very striking and effective feature. Below the
Kitchen a cellar of the same shape and size has a well-groined vaulted roof
carried on a central pillar. Another to the east, which has a large double
fire-place at one end, has a strongly ribbed circular segmental vault. All the
first-floor chambers of the west front, including Clifford’s Tower, have plain
barrel vaults. The lower chamber of Bulmer’s Tower had till lately a
richly groined vault of great strength and beauty. The Hall Tower has
both its lower stories vaulted; the first ribbed, the second plain. The
whole of this tower, inside and out, has been wonderfully preserved.
Vaults, windows, grilles, doorways, stairs, garde-robes, all are nearly intact,
and will bear careful examination. It is really the most perfect thing in
the place. The Chapel, all mutilated as it is, still deserves notice. The
Sanctuary, which forms the central portion of a tower, has a boldly ribbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1262" id="Page_1262">[1262]</a></span>
quadripartite vault. Above it is a guard-chamber. Its exterior window,
above the eastern one of the Chapel, is marked by a very remarkable little
hanging machicoulis.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Raby Castle, West Side.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The entrance to Raby is by the Porter’s Lodge in the north-west portion
of the embattled outer wall. In this Lodge are found some family relics;
among others, the sword worn by Lord Barnard, son of the first Earl of
Darlington, at the battle of Fontenoy, where a bullet, striking his sword,
broke it, and then, glancing off, disabled its wearer. The Gateway is
flanked by two towers, each of which is surmounted by a figure of a mail
clad warrior.</p>

<p>The main entrance to the castle itself is on the west side, between two
towers. It is a long passage, with groined roof and traces of portcullis;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1263" id="Page_1263">[1263]</a></span>
and carriages drive through this passage into the Quadrangle, or Court-yard.
Crossing this, and facing the main entrance just alluded to, is the
enormous doorway opening into the Great or Entrance Hall. Through
this doorway the carriages literally drive into the mansion, and there set
down the guests in the Hall itself, which is of great size, with an arched
roof, supported by eight octagonal pillars in its centre. “When the
brilliant gas above combines its glare with that of two enormous fires, and
the roof is echoing to the tramp of horses and the roll of wheels, the visitor
cannot but be struck with the unusual entrance,” says a recent writer. In
this Hall is hung Turner’s famous picture of Raby Castle.</p>

<p>Above this Great Hall is the famous Baron’s Hall immortalised by
Wordsworth, where</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Seven hundred knights, retainers all<br />
Of Neville, at the muster’s call,<br />
Had sate together in Raby’s hall.”</p>

<p class="pn1">This Hall, which is 126 feet long by 36 feet broad, is ceiled with oak and
contains a large number of family portraits; also “Interior of an Artist’s
Studio,” by Teniers, and portraits of Queen Elizabeth, Cromwell, James II.,
and Frederick, Prince of Wales. The south end of the room is modern,
being built over the Octagon Drawing-room. A staircase leads from the
Baron’s Hall to the Chapel, renovated by the second duke. Some of the
windows are filled with stained glass by Wailes; others with old German
glass. The Chapel contains Murillo’s “St. Catherine” and “The Saviour
bearing the Cross.”</p>

<p>In most of the apartments of the castle are many fine pictures, portraits
and others, among which are the Duke of Cleveland, son of Charles II.;
Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland; Lady Barnard, wife of Christopher,
Lord Barnard; Harry, second Duke of Cleveland, in his Garter robes;
and the first Duke of Cleveland in his uniform as Colonel of the Durham
Militia. The Octagon Drawing-room, built by the second duke, is, in
all its details, a most elaborate and highly finished apartment. The
furniture is elegant. In this room is Hiram Powers’ celebrated statue
of the “Greek Slave,” purchased by the second Duke of Cleveland for
£1,800.</p>

<p>The Kitchen is a fine specimen of mediæval architecture, and is evidence
of the lavish hospitality of a former age. “The enormous oven would have
baked bread for an army, and is described by Pennant as being, in his time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1264" id="Page_1264">[1264]</a></span>
used as a wine-cellar, ‘the sides being divided into two parts, and each part
holding a hogshead of wine in bottles.’”</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to enter further into the details of the interior
arrangements of the castle. All we need say is, that the rooms are fitted
and furnished with all the appliances of Art which might be expected in
the home of so enlightened and so liberal-minded a nobleman as his Grace
the Duke of Cleveland.</p>

<p>Staindrop, closely adjoining Raby Park, is an interesting town, whose
Church contains many monuments to members of the noble families of
Nevil and Vane. The Church was restored in 1849. Among the monuments,
perhaps the most interesting are an altar-tomb, with recumbent
effigies, to Ralph Nevil, Earl of Westmoreland, and his two wives,
Margaret, daughter to Hugh, Earl of Stafford, and Joan, daughter to
John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; and a monument in wood, with effigies
of Henry, fifth Earl of Westmoreland (1564), and his two wives. There
is also a magnificent white marble altar-tomb to the first Duke of Cleveland,
by Westmacott, the recumbent figure on which is beautifully executed. In
the chancel there is a monument, of exquisite design, in the purest white
marble, in memory of Sophia, Duchess of Cleveland (wife of the second
duke), who died in 1859. Within the altar-rails are other monuments,
including those of Henry, second Earl of Darlington, who died in 1792;
Margaret, Countess of Darlington, who died in 1800; and Katharine
Margaret, Countess of Darlington, who died in 1807. There are also
stained-glass windows in memory of Henry, second Duke of Cleveland;
one erected by the friends and tenants of the Duke, and the other by
Lady Augusta Powlett, his sister-in-law. A monumental brass of chaste
design, on the north side of the Church, preserves the memory of William,
third Duke of Cleveland. North of the Church is a Mausoleum, erected by
the second Duke of Cleveland, in which the remains of the Duke and other
members of the family repose.</p>

<p class="dc13 p4">OUR notice of “charming Cliefden” must necessarily be brief; not
because the “Stately Home” itself lacks of stateliness, of beauty,
of grandeur, or of interest; not because the episodes in its history
are “few and far between,” or devoid of incident; not because its
glorious situation and its picturesque surroundings present few
features for the pen to dwell upon, and the poetic or artistic mind to
linger over; and not because the genealogies of the families to which
it has belonged will not vie both in point of antiquity, in fame, and in noble
and illustrious actions with others; but simply because the space at our
disposal will admit only of words where we would gladly have written
paragraphs. In interest, in beauty, and picturesque surroundings, Cliefden
will bear favourable comparison with most others of our series, while it
yields to none in the loveliness, the romantic beauty, and the attractiveness
of its situation. To take only a cursory glance at such a place is like peeping
in at the door of a picture gallery, without having time to note any of the
treasures spread on its walls.</p>

<p>Cliefden, now one of the seats of his Grace the Duke of Westminster,
is situated in Buckinghamshire, and overlooks the river Thames in its most
attractive part. It is to Cliefden that the river here owes its chief loveliness,
but it is also to the river that Cliefden is indebted for one of its principal
attractions. From the Berkshire side of the Thames the woods and the mansion
form a magnificent scene, but it is from the bosom of the stream that its
beauties are best understood and most enjoyed. “Cliefden runs along the
summit of a lofty ridge which overhangs the river. The outline of this
ridge is broken in the most agreeable way; the steep bank is covered with
luxuriant foliage, forming a hanging wood of great beauty, or in parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1266" id="Page_1266">[1266]</a></span>
bare, so as to increase the gracefulness of the foliage by the contrast; and
the whole bank has run into easy-flowing curves at the bidding of the noble
stream which washes its base. A few islands deck this part of the river,
and occasionally little tongues of land run out into it, or a tree overhangs
it, helping to give vigour to the foreground of the rich landscape. From
the summit the views are really magnificent; both up and down the river
they are of surpassing beauty. Looking over Windsor, the eye ranges far
away till it loses itself in the hazy distance, to which the royal pile gives an
aërial grace, while it adds majesty to the whole view. Looking up the
river towards Hedsor the charming seat of Lord Boston, we have a prospect
little less splendid, though of a different character. A vast extent of
country lies at one’s feet, covered with dense wooded tracts, from which
ever and anon peeps up an old grey tower; and the blue smoke marks a
secluded village, while the glorious river winds away like a broad stream
of molten silver.” The immediate grounds, whether Thamesward or landward,
are well laid out, and present at every turn spots of beauty and
loveliness not excelled elsewhere.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Cliefden.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Speaking of the river scenery about Cliefden, Mr. Hall, in his “Book
of the Thames,” says, “Those who accuse our great island river of
insipidity, who, if they concede its claims to beauty, deny its pretensions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1267" id="Page_1267">[1267]</a></span>
grandeur, will do well to row beneath the thick woods of Taplow and
Cliefden, and, looking up, they will have no difficulty in imagining themselves
in one of the grandest and richest, in picturesque attractions, of our
English lakes; indeed, they will require only the near and distant mountains
to fancy themselves under the heights of Glena, in all-beautiful Killarney.
Well may we rejoice to scan the charms of our glorious river, and ask the
aid of Poetry and Art to give them fame and power. But the painter
will fail here. He may select graceful nooks, and a thousand objects will,
singly or in groups, present themselves as fitting subjects for his pencil;
but he cannot convey to the eye and mind a just idea of the mingled
grandeur and beauty of this delicious locality; while the poet will find only
themes which have been, ever and everywhere, the chosen and the favoured
of his order. Those who row past these charming woods, and note what
has been done by taste, in association with wealth, to render every part
delightful, ascend any of the heights and examine the ‘prospect,’ near
or distant, their enjoyment will be largely enhanced. It is impossible,
indeed, to exaggerate the beauty and harmony of the foliage which everywhere
surrounds us:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">‘Beautiful in various dyes,<br />
The gloomy pine, the poplar blue,<br />
The yellow beech, the sable yew,<br />
The slender fir that taper grows.<br />
The sturdy oak with broad-spread boughs;<br />
And, beyond., the purple grove.<br />
Haunt of Phyllis&mdash;Queen of Love!’</p>

<p class="pn1">But there are here hundreds of other trees which the poet could not
commemorate, for they were unknown in England in his time. All climes
and countries have contributed to the wealth of foliage at Cliefden&mdash;woods,
lawns, and gardens are enriched by tributes from every land to which
enterprise has conducted British science to gather treasures converted from
exotics into subjects naturalised and ‘at home.’”</p>

<p>Cliefden formerly belonged to the ancient family of Manfeld, of Buckinghamshire,
from whom it was purchased by the infamously profligate George
Villiers, second Duke of Buckingham, who built the mansion, and expended
large sums of money in laying out the grounds and planting them with all
the rarities of arboriculture he could procure. He employed Archer, the
architect, to design and erect the mansion, and to adorn the grounds with
alcoves and other buildings of a like nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1268" id="Page_1268">[1268]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>The Thames at Cliefden.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The house was a commanding
square structure, of three stories in height, besides the terrace (440 feet long),
and it had wings connected with the main building by a colonnade. It was
built of red brick, with stone dressings. He furnished it in a sumptuous
manner, and hung its walls with fine tapestry and valuable pictures. Here
the Duke brought his mistress, the Countess of Shrewsbury, and here gave
full bent to his licentious habits. Thus Cliefden gained an unenviable
notoriety, and has been immortalised in song and in prose:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Gallant and gay, in Cliefden’s proud alcove,<br />
The bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love.”</p>

<p class="pn1">In 1667-8 the Duke had taken part in a singular triple duel about the Countess,
and had mortally wounded her husband by running him through the body.
Pepys thus wrote of this duel:&mdash;“January 17th. Much discourse of the
duell yesterday between the Duke of Buckingham, Holmes, and one
Jenkins, on one side, and my Lord of Shrewsbury, Sir John Talbot, and
one Bernard Howard, on the other side: and all about my Lady Shrewsbury,
who is at this time, and hath for a great while been, a mistress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1269" id="Page_1269">[1269]</a></span>
to the Duke of Buckingham. And so her husband challenged him, and
they met yesterday in a close near Barne-Elmes, and there fought: and my
Lord Shrewsbury is run through the body, from the right breast through the
shoulder; and Sir John Talbot all along up one of his armes; and Jenkins
killed upon the place, and the rest all in a little measure wounded.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Cliefden: the Cottage.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This will make the world think that the King hath good counsellors about him,
when the Duke of Buckingham, the greatest man about him, is a fellow of
no more sobriety than to fight about a mistress. And this may prove a very
bad accident to the Duke of Buckingham, but that my Lady Castlemaine
do rule all at this time as much as ever she did, and she will, it is believed,
keep all matters well with the Duke of Buckingham; though this is a time
that the King will be very backward, I suppose, to appear in such a
business. And it is pretty to hear how the King had some notice of this
challenge a week or two ago, and did give it to my Lord Generall to confine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1270" id="Page_1270">[1270]</a></span>
the Duke, or take security that he should not do any such thing as fight:
and the Generall trusted to the King that he, sending for him, would do it;
and the King trusted to the Generall. And it is said that my Lord
Shrewsbury’s case is to be feared that he may die too: and that may make
it much worse for the Duke of Buckingham: and I shall not be much
sorry for it, that we may have some sober man come in his room to assist
in the Government.”</p>

         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>Cliefden: the Summer Cottage.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Countess of Shrewsbury (the Duke’s mistress), who was Anna
Maria, daughter of Robert, Earl of Cardigan, is said to have held the
Duke’s horse, habited as a page, while the duel was being fought, and that
she thus not only saw her husband mortally wounded, but then went home
with the murderer, where she took him to her arms “in the shirt covered
with her husband’s blood.” The Duke was married to the Hon. Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1271" id="Page_1271">[1271]</a></span>
Fairfax, daughter and heiress of Lord Fairfax, the Parliamentary general&mdash;a
woman of pure tastes and faultless habits&mdash;whom he shamefully
neglected. Pepys, under date the 15th of May, 1668, says, “I am told also
that the Countesse of Shrewsbury is brought home by the Duke [the Earl
had died of his wounds in March] of Buckingham to his house, where his
Duchesse, saying that it was not for her and the other to live together in a
house, he answered, ‘<i>Why, madam, I did think so, and therefore have ordered
your coach to be ready to carry you to your father’s</i>;’ which was a devilish
speech, but, they say, true; and my Lady Shrewsbury is there, it seems.”</p>

<p>Large as was the income of the Duke, his profligacy, extravagance, and
immoralities so swallowed it up that he did not complete Cliefden, and died
in wretchedness; and but for the timely help of Lord Arran, a few days
before his decease, in abject poverty and loneliness. “There is not,”
wrote Lord Arran, “so much as one farthing towards defraying the least
expense;” and Pope, in one of his epistles to Lord Bathurst, remarks&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Behold! what blessings wealth to life can lend,<br />
And see what comforts it affords our end!<br />
In the worst inn’s worst room, with mat half-hung,<br />
The floors of plaster, and the walls of dung,<br />
On once a flock bed, but repaired with straw,<br />
With tape-tied curtains, never meant to draw,<br />
The George and Garter dangling from that bed,<br />
Where tawdry yellow strove with dirty red,<br />
Great Villiers lies&mdash;alas! how changed from him,<br />
That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim,<br />
Gallant and gay in Cliefden’s proud alcove,<br />
Tho bower of wanton Shrewsbury and love;<br />
Or just as gay at council in a ring<br />
Of mimick’d statesmen and their merry king.<br />
No wit to flatter, left off all his store;<br />
No fool to laugh at, which he valued more;<br />
There victor of his health, of fortune, friends,<br />
And fame, this lord of useless thousands ends.”</p>

<p class="p1">Soon after the Duke’s death all his property, being deeply mortgaged,
was sold, but did not realise enough to pay his debts; and dying without
issue, “his titles, which had been undeservedly conferred on his father, and
only disgraced by himself, became extinct.”</p>

<p>Cliefden was purchased by Lord George Hamilton (fifth son of the Duke
of Hamilton), who was created Baron Dechemont of Linlithgow, Viscount
Kirkwall of Orkney, and Earl of Orkney, in 1696. His lordship completed
the mansion, and did much towards beautifying the grounds. Dying without
male issue in 1737, his eldest daughter, Anne, became Countess of Orkney,
and succeeded to the Cliefden estate. She, however, did not reside here, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1272" id="Page_1272">[1272]</a></span>
let it to H.R.H. Frederick, Prince of Wales, father of King George III.,
who for many years made it his summer residence. Here, at Cliefden, on
the 1st of August, 1740, was first performed Thomson and Mallet’s masque
of <i>Alfred</i>, in which occurs the ever-famous and patriotic “ode in honour of
Great Britain,” “Rule Britannia”&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“When Britain first, at Heav’n’s command,</p>
<p class="pp7">Arose from out the azure main”&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">the music of which was composed by Dr. Arne. It was, therefore, within
the walls of Cliefden that “Rule Britannia” was first heard, and this
gives it a literary interest of no small note. The masque in which it
formed so prominent a feature was prepared and given at Cliefden, to
commemorate the accession to the throne, in 1714, of King George I.
(grandfather of Frederick, Prince of Wales), and in honour of the third
birthday of his daughter, the young Princess Augusta. It was repeated
the following night, and soon became the most popular of all compositions.</p>

<p>In 1795 the mansion (it is traditionally said through the carelessness of
a maid-servant reading a novel in bed) was totally destroyed by fire, the
wings, at some distance from the main building, being alone saved; while
nearly all the sumptuous furniture, pictures, and tapestry were devoured
by the flames. The estate was afterwards purchased by Sir George
Warrender, by whom the mansion, which had been left in ruins since the
fire, was rebuilt in 1830. After his death the estate was sold by Sir
George’s executors to his Grace the Duke of Sutherland, and on the 15th
of November, 1849 (the day of thanksgiving for the cessation of the
cholera), only a few months after its purchase, it was again burned down.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1850, the Duke of Sutherland set about rebuilding
the mansion on a scale of princely magnificence, and having engaged
the services of Barry as architect, the present pile soon rose from the ruins
of the former buildings. The “centre portion, which is a revival of the
design for old Somerset House, now extends to the wings, which, together
with the terrace, are made to harmonize with the new building.” The
house and grounds, like Trentham, owe much of their beauty and loveliness
to the good taste of the Duke and Duchess, the latter of whom, when
a dowager, made it one of her favourite residences. The interior of this
“Stately Home” needs no particular description. The rooms are, of course,
one and all sumptuously furnished with all the appliances of wealth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1273" id="Page_1273">[1273]</a></span>
taste, and are lavish in their attractions. It is truly a “home of beauty and
of taste.”</p>

<p>Cliefden passed from the Duke of Sutherland to his daughter, the Lady
Constance Leveson-Gower, married to the present Duke of Westminster,
whose property this splendid domain is.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The Principal Front.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The family of Grosvenor, of which the present owner of Cliefden is the
illustrious head, is one of high antiquity, tracing, as it does, in England,
from the Norman conquest, when his grace’s ancestor came over with
William the Conqueror. The principal line of the Grosvenors was seated at
Hulme, in the hundred of Northwich, in Cheshire, and was descended in
direct line from Gilbert le Grosvenour, nephew of Hugh Lupus, the
Norman Earl Palatine of Chester, whom he accompanied to this country.
The name, it is said, was derived from <i>le Gros Venour</i>, from the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1274" id="Page_1274">[1274]</a></span>
having held the hereditary post of chief huntsman to the Dukes of Normandy.
This main line was extinct in the twenty-second year of the reign
of Henry VI., the line being continued by Ralph Grosvenor, second son of
Sir Thomas Grosvenor, of Hulme. He married Joan Eaton, daughter and
sole heiress of John Eaton, of Eaton, or Eton, in Cheshire, Esq., early in
the fifteenth century. In 1621-2 a baronetcy was conferred on the representative
of the family; and in 1676, Sir Thomas Grosvenor having married
Mary, sole daughter and heiress of Alexander Davies, of Ebury, in the
county of Middlesex, Esq., laid the foundation of the immense wealth and
rapidly increasing honours of the Grosvenors.</p>

<p>In 1761 the then baronet, Sir Richard Grosvenor, was elevated to the
peerage by the title of Baron Grosvenor of Eaton, in Cheshire, and in 1781
was advanced to the titles of Viscount Belgrave and Earl Grosvenor. He
married Henrietta, daughter of Henry Vernon, Esq., by whom he had issue
an only son, Robert Grosvenor. The Earl died in 1802, and was succeeded
by his son, Robert Grosvenor, as second earl.</p>

<p>This nobleman was born in 1767, and married, in 1794, the Lady
Eleanor Egerton, daughter of the first Earl of Wilton, by whom he had
issue his successor, Lord Richard, who became third earl and second
marquis; Lord Thomas, who became Earl of Wilton; and Lord Robert,
M.P. In 1831 Earl Grosvenor was advanced to the dignity of a marquis,
by the title of Marquis of Westminster being conferred upon him. He
died in 1845, and was succeeded by his eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>Richard, second Marquis of Westminster and third Earl Grosvenor.
He was born in 1795, and in 1819 married the Lady Elizabeth Mary
Leveson-Gower, second daughter of the first Duke of Sutherland, and by
her had issue a family of four sons and nine daughters. His lordship,
dying in 1869, was succeeded by his eldest son, the present peer, Hugh
Lupus Grosvenor, in all his titles and estates, who, in 1874, was created
Duke of Westminster.</p>

<p>The present noble head of this illustrious family, his Grace, Hugh Lupus,
first Duke and third Marquis of Westminster, Earl Grosvenor, Viscount
Belgrave, Baron Grosvenor of Eaton, a Baronet, and a Knight of the Garter,
was born on the 13th of October, 1825, and succeeded his father in 1869.
His grace was educated at Eton and at Balliol College, Oxford, and represented
Chester in Parliament from 1847 to 1869, when he entered the Upper
House. In 1852 his grace, then Marquis of Westminster, married his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1275" id="Page_1275">[1275]</a></span>
cousin, the Lady Constance Leveson-Gower, daughter of the second Duke
of Sutherland, and sister of the present noble owner of Trentham. By
this union his grace has issue, living, five sons and three daughters. These
are&mdash;Victor Alexander, by courtesy Marquis of Westminster, to whom (born
in 1853) her Majesty the Queen stood sponsor in person, who married, in
1874, the Lady Sibell Mary Lumley, daughter of the Earl of Scarborough,
by whom he has issue, and is heir to the titles and estates; Lord Arthur
Hugh Grosvenor, born in 1863; Lord Henry George Grosvenor, born in
1864; Lord Robert Edward Grosvenor, born in 1869; Lord Gerald Richard
Grosvenor, born in 1874; the Lady Elizabeth Harriet, born in 1856; the
Lady Beatrice Constance, born in 1858; and the Lady Margaret Evelyn,
born in 1873.</p>

<p>The Duke of Westminster is patron of eleven livings, four of which
are London churches; and his seats are Eaton Hall, Cheshire; Cliefden,
Buckinghamshire; Halkin, Flintshire; and the mansion in Upper Grosvenor
Street.</p>

<p>The ancient arms of the Grosvenors, settled in the famous Scrope and
Grosvenor trial in the fourteenth century, were claimed to be <i>azure</i>, a bend,
<i>or</i>; but these were declared to belong to Scrope. Sir Richard Grosvenor
then, after the trial, assumed the arms <i>azure</i>, a garb, <i>or</i>, as showing his
descent from the ancient Earls of Chester. On or after the creation of
the marquisate of Westminster the arms of that city were granted as an
augmentation, and ordered to be borne quarterly with those of Grosvenor.
The arms now are&mdash;quarterly, first and fourth, <i>azure</i>, a portcullis with chains
pendent, <i>or</i>; on a chief of the last, in pale, the arms of King Edward the
Confessor, between two united roses of York and Lancaster (being the
arms of the city of Westminster); second and third, <i>azure</i>, a garb, <i>or</i>, for
Grosvenor. Crest&mdash;a talbot statant, <i>or</i>. Supporters&mdash;two talbots reguardant,
<i>or</i>, collared, <i>azure</i>. Motto&mdash;“Virtus non stemma.”</p>

<p>The glorious grounds of Cliefden have been pleasantly discoursed upon
by many writers, but by none more graphically or technically than in a brief
notice in the <i>Garden</i>, which to some extent we cannot do better than quote.
Cliefden, “the birthplace of spring gardening,” he says, “well maintains
the high character it has so long and deservedly received for the beauty
of its early flowers, its banks full of wild hyacinths, primroses, and forget-me-nots;
its closely shaven lawns so overspread with wild thyme that every
footstep brushes up its fragrance; and, above all, its flower-beds brimful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1276" id="Page_1276">[1276]</a></span>
of spring beauty, which in turn give place to summer bedding plants.
Looking from the terrace on the lawn, a huge sunken panel with flower-beds
proportionate in size on either side of it, the floral display when we
saw it was magnificent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>The Summer House.</i></p>

<p>Brilliant pink, supplied by a large circle of <i>Silene
pendula compacta</i>, set in emerald green, was conspicuous in the distance;
nearer were lavender and blue, furnished by <i>Nepeta cærulea</i> and forget-me-nots;
buff, by <i>Limnanthes Douglasi</i>; golden yellow, by <i>Lasthenia Californica</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1277" id="Page_1277">[1277]</a></span>
and crimson, by the old China rose of that colour and rhododendrons. Other
colours, too, were equally striking, and these only a secondary display, that
earlier and brighter being made by early tulips. The plan is, when the
tulips are planted, to cover the surface of the beds with annuals, sown in
July and August, and transplanted when the bulbs are put in. These
commence flowering when the tulips are over, and remain in beauty until
the bedding plants are planted out. Vasefuls of Tom Thumb pelargoniums
stand on the grass near the walk at the base of the terrace wall, close to
which is a ribbon border bright with pansies, for which Cliefden is justly
celebrated; and right and left are gardens of early flowers, arranged on the
one hand in the form of a huge shell, and on the other in beds on the grass
that have been bright all the season with spring flowers in great beauty.
But, brilliant as the floral display on the dressed ground undoubtedly has
been, and soon will be again, it cannot arrest attention long. The eye is
naturally carried beyond it to the wood-clad hills and dales, the rich meadows,
and the river Thames, at this season alive with water-parties from
Maidenhead and pleasure-boats of every description. These form the foreground,
as it were, to a landscape unmatched for picturesque beauty, its
distant boundary being the Surrey hills on the one hand, and the Chilterns,
in Buckinghamshire, on the other.</p>

<p>“Vistas, too, have been cut here and there through the trees, so as to
bring into view the water or some more distant object of interest. By
reclaiming pieces of land here and there from the river, a wide and agreeable
promenade has been formed along its bank, overhung at intervals by stately
trees, consisting of beech, ash, and elm, with here and there a tulip-tree
and scarlet chestnut. This is reached from the plateau above, on which the
mansion stands, by means of winding walks and flights of rustic steps,
through what may be termed a gigantic wild garden, consisting of ancient
yews, whose hold on mother earth is but small, their roots&mdash;weather-beaten
and weird-looking&mdash;being half out of the ground, and tangled brushwood,
fantastically overrun in places with honeysuckle and traveller’s joy. Here,
too, even on the chalk, are masses of ferns, and nearer the river-side a very
fine Judas-tree, clumps of pampas grass, mulberry-coloured hazels, and
other flowering and fine-leaved subjects, while in spring every open space
is a garden of wild flowers.</p>

<p>“Let us now return to the entrance front of the mansion. This has been
strikingly improved, by removing the old kitchen garden, and laying its site<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1278" id="Page_1278">[1278]</a></span>
down in grass as level as a bowling-green, cut off from its surroundings
right and left by newly built walls, and in front by a thick yew hedge, still
kept in vigour by means of good root treatment. These, with the mansion,
enclose a spacious quadrangle, on the side of which farthest from the
windows are large vases; these in early spring are gay with tulips, and later
in the season with annuals, the most effective of which is <i>Silene pendula
compacta</i> in masses of rosy blossoms. On the walls, which are covered with
climbing and other wall plants, are rare roses, and honeysuckles in profusion.
In another part is a rose hedge, consisting of Fellenberg, a kind not
very full when open, but excellent in the bud state for table decoration.</p>

<p>“Shut out from view of the mansion by these walls are the glasshouses,
a conservatory being on the one side, and the forcing-houses on the other&mdash;all
new, and arranged with consummate skill and forethought, as regards
saving of labour: the whole, with the exception of the conservatory, are
built in parallel lines right and left of a central pathway, under which are
the hot-water pipes, a glass-covered corridor running round the whole, and
binding them, as it were, together. Close to them are the offices and young
men’s rooms, the latter built in a style and furnished with appliances such
as are to be found in but few gardens. Grapes, peaches, and other tender
fruits are grown here in perfection, and among other things we noticed a
houseful of tree, or perpetual, carnations in flower, a brilliant sight&mdash;the
blooms being abundant, large, and fragrant. The extension system of vine-growing
is that which is most in favour here. In one vinery&mdash;an old one,
sixty feet long&mdash;one vine has been allowed to fill the house; it is in excellent
condition, and is carrying some two hundred bunches of promising fruit.
Near here, too, is a glass corridor, the roof of which is covered with an aged
fuchsia of the corallina kind; several other varieties have been grafted on
it, all of which are literally masses of flower, and most effective, owing to
the contrast produced by their different colours. Ivies, grown in zinc boxes
and trained on trellises for indoor screens, are here out of doors in the
shade. These fit into ornamental trays, and when taken indoors have a
pelargonium or nasturtium, or some other flowering plant plunged in the
box in front of them.</p>

<p>“The conservatory is fifty-six yards in length and twelve yards in width,
and span-roofed, the spans being placed at right angles with the wall
against which it is built.  It is in two divisions, but so arranged that both
can be thrown into one, which, when lighted up at night (which it is on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1279" id="Page_1279">[1279]</a></span>
certain occasions) has a fine effect. It is as gay as a house of the kind can
well be&mdash;arum lilies, as they are called, being especially good and conspicuous.
Among the more arborescent vegetation which it contains are
oranges, carrying heavy crops of ripe fruit, and a vigorous specimen of
<i>Abutilon Boule de Neige</i>, loaded with drooping white bell-shaped flowers,
which, when inverted in bouquets with the stamens removed, have a
charming effect. Against the back wall is <i>Lantana mutabilis</i>, quite a mass
of variously coloured flowers, exhibiting, in fact, a luxuriance of blossom
wholly unattainable by plants in pots.</p>

<p>“With the noble entrance to Cliefden most people are familiar. It consists
of a straight avenue of dimensions commensurate with the palatial
residence to which it leads. This remains as it always has been; but the
approach in connection with it has of late been greatly altered and improved.
On the one side we have natural wood intermixed with flowering shrubs
and trees; and on the other, here and there glades of grass pleasantly
undulated, and furnished with clumps of rhododendrons and azaleas&mdash;some
near, some distant, but all effectively planted, and more or less over-canopied
with lofty trees, chiefly beeches, whose stems rise for an unusual
height clear of branches. A large stagnant pond, by which the road passes,
has been drained, filled up, and converted into a grassy lawn, one side of
which hugs the approach for a considerable distance, while the other loses
itself in the wood on the other side of the valley. Vistas, too, have been
judiciously cut through the trees where the planting and views are most
beautiful, thus rendering this portion of the grounds by no means the least
interesting feature of Cliefden.</p>

<p>“Of the kitchen garden we have said nothing; nor of the miles of green
drives, in summer shady and pleasant, with which the woods abound; nor of
the indoor fruit-growing, which is excellent; but enough has been said to
show that Cliefden, since it has become the property of the Duke of Westminster,
has been greatly improved, both as regards its buildings and its
gardens, and is now one of the most charming of seats.”</p>

</div>
<p class="dc16 p4">WE have chosen Warnham Court to form one of our present series, not
because it is, strictly speaking, a “<i>Stately</i> Home,” nor because
its history is a stirring one, or the family to whom it belongs
can boast of high antiquity in descent, or of nobility in extraction;
but simply because it is a good and pleasing and fine example of
a modern Elizabethan home, the characteristic features of which
have been made suitable for the tastes and requirements of the present
day. Its beauties are manifold, but they are purely of that quiet domestic
character that is utterly opposed to ostentation and show, and that give
it an air of comfort possessed by but few of its more pretentious neighbours.</p>

<p>Sussex is a county of “many mansions,” and they are as varied in their
style and their architectural character as they are in the periods in which
they have been erected; but few can, out of the whole, compare with Warnham
Court in pleasantness of situation, in beauty of external surroundings,
or in comfort of internal arrangements. It is a house fitted for hospitality,
and for the enjoyment of the guests its owner delights to have around
him.</p>

<p>Warnham Court lies near the village of Warnham, which is about three
miles from Horsham, and it has a station on the Horsham line of the London,
Brighton, and South Coast Railway. The village&mdash;and a pretty Sussex
village it is&mdash;consists mainly of one long street, running north and south,
and it has many pleasant residences in its neighbourhood. The Church,
dedicated to St. Margaret, is of Norman foundation, but was enlarged and
altered in 1848. It consists of “a nave, with north and south aisles, with
three chancels, the north of these latter portions being divided from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1281" id="Page_1281">[1281]</a></span>
south aisle by a fine Gothic oak screen. It has a square embattled tower,
with clock and six bells. The interior contains several monuments” to
the Carills and others.</p>

         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>Distant View from the Lake.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Court was built in the Elizabethan style, in
place of an older house, in the beginning of this century, by Henry Tredcroft,
Esq., of Horsham&mdash;a fine old Sussex squire&mdash;and, at his death, was
sold to Sir Thomas Pelley, Bart., who made it his residence. The whole
estate passed, by purchase, from the executors of Sir Henry Pelley, in 1866,
to its present owner, Charles T. Lucas, Esq., the head of the well-known
firm of Lucas Brothers, the eminent builders and contractors. By Mr.
Lucas the house has been remodelled and considerably enlarged, its Elizabethan
character being, however, carefully preserved in every detail. He
has also built new stabling, lodges, gardener’s house, terraces, garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1282" id="Page_1282">[1282]</a></span>
appliances, &amp;c., at a very large outlay, which, however, has been most
judiciously expended.</p>

<p>Mr. Lucas, who is the eldest son of the late James Lucas, Esq., was
born in 1820, and in 1840 was married to Miss Tiffin, by whom he has,
with other issue, a son, Charles James Lucas, born in 1853, and educated
at Harrow. Mr. Lucas is Lord of the Manor of Warnham, a governor of
Christ’s Hospital, and a magistrate for the county of Surrey. He is brother
to his partner, Thomas Lucas, Esq., of Eastwicke Park, Surrey, who was
born in 1822, and in 1852 married Mary Amelia, daughter of Robert
Chamberlain, Esq., of Cotton Hall, Norfolk, by whom, with other issue,
he has a son, Arthur Charles Lucas, born in 1853, and educated at
Harrow: he is a J.P. and D.L. for Suffolk, and a magistrate for
Middlesex and Westminster. Both are gentlemen highly esteemed and
honoured, and few are more thoroughly entitled to the lofty positions to
which, by honourable industry, great ability, and high character, they
have attained.</p>

<p>The arms of the family of Lucas are&mdash;party per bend, <i>gules</i> and <i>argent</i>, a
bend, dovetailed, between six annulets, all counterchanged; a crescent for
difference. Crest&mdash;a demi-griffin, wings expanded, <i>gules</i>, semée of annulets,
<i>argent</i>. Motto&mdash;“Spes et fides.”</p>

<p>The mansion is approached from the principal Lodge Entrance by a
drive through the park, which is finely timbered with forest trees of large
growth. These are chiefly oaks, of which there are some remarkably fine
and gigantic examples. Under these roam innumerable herds of red and
fallow deer, which add much to the beauty of the park scenery. The
Lodge, with its overhanging roofs, its mullioned windows, its geometrical
chimney-shafts, and its advanced porch, is one of the most picturesque and
pleasant in the county.</p>

<p>The mansion itself is situated on an eminence, and commands extensive
views of the surrounding country. On the east side is the Carriage Entrance,
which is a spacious gravelled court-yard, enclosed next the park by a stone
balustrade. On the south side is the South or Grand Terrace, a fine
promenade walk some six hundred feet in length by twenty feet in width,
adorned with statuary, and overhung and shaded by magnificent trees.
This terrace is supported, at an elevation from the park of about ten
feet, by a massive stone wall and elegantly designed balustrade. In the
recesses are fine examples of sculpture, and the balustrade itself supports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1283" id="Page_1283">[1283]</a></span>
a number of elegant vases, terminals, and other ornaments, placed at regular
distances. The park from this point slopes gently away till it ends in a
fine ornamental Lake. Looking to the eastward, down a lovely glade in
the park, another and more magnificent piece of water, covering an area
of over thirty acres, is seen in the distance.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>The South or Grand Terrace.</i></p>
</div>

<p>On the right, while passing along to the west end of this terrace, stands
the Conservatory. It is filled with the choicest exotic palms, tree ferns,
and flowering plants; and in the centre, on a massive marble base, stands
a magnificent sculptured group of figures in white marble. The floor is
geometrical in pattern, and the appointments, the vases, the flower-stands,
&amp;c., are all characterized by good taste in their arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1284" id="Page_1284">[1284]</a></span></p>

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Garden Front.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The surrounding grounds are beautifully undulating and diversified,
and comprise the Flower Garden, Croquet Lawn, and American Garden.
The latter is situated in a natural dip of the grounds, and is completely
encircled and sheltered by a dense mass of oaks and other forest trees,
at the foot of which is a broad belt of common laurel, rhododendron, &amp;c.
Then follows a winding walk, encircling about an acre of grass lawn, on
which are planted masses of azalea, rhododendron, kalmea, andromeda,
specimen coniferæ, &amp;c., the whole producing a strikingly pleasing effect.
Arrived at the end of this terrace, the visitor descends, by means of a broad
flight of steps, to another terrace walk nearly a quarter of a mile in length,
and flanked for most of that distance on each side with masses of rhododendrons
alternated with some fine specimens of <i>Cedrus deodara</i> and the
Chinese juniper. Again descending by another flight of steps to the left,
access is gained to the Rose Garden. This “garden of roses,” which is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1285" id="Page_1285">[1285]</a></span>
perfect Eastern loveliness, takes the form of a half-circle, the whole of which
is filled with the choicest roses, the outer line being backed by a broad belt
of flowering rhododendrons. Some idea may be formed of the size and
importance of this Rose Garden from the fact that it contains upwards of
a thousand standard roses, and nearly as many dwarf roses, and these
comprise examples of every colour, shade, and variety that are worth cultivating.
The effect, when these are fully in flower, is enchanting in the
extreme.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>The Mansion and Conservatory, from the Grounds.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In close proximity to this, but shut out by a high wall covered with
<i>Magnolia grandiflora</i>, are the Forcing and Plant Houses: these occupy three
sides of a square. Passing through the upper side, which is a range of
span-roofed houses, we find it embraces a Show House (kept gay with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1286" id="Page_1286">[1286]</a></span>
flowers the year round), Fernery, Plant, Stove, and Camellia House, in which
latter is a plant of the old double white camellia twenty feet across, and
rather more than that in height, besides many other fine specimens of those
choicest and most beautiful of flowers. Leaving this house, the visitor
passes through about two hundred feet in length of Vineries and Peach
Houses, filled with their luscious treasures in different stages of growth.
Thus the third side of the square is gained. This is another range of span
Plant Houses, the centre division being a Rose House, planted chiefly with
tea-scented roses. In the centre of this square, and running parallel with
the two end ranges, is a large late Peach House, 65 feet long by 24
feet wide: this spans the walk which connects this square with the lower
terrace.</p>

<p>At the back of these houses are the Kitchen Gardens, which comprise
about four acres: these are well walled, and have a good wall to the south.
The soil being a retentive clay, fruit trees, as well as most vegetables,
thrive well. Here, also, are extensive ranges of pits used for forcing early
vegetables, pot vines, melons, cucumbers, and bedding plants, of which
latter about thirty thousand are grown and planted annually. Here, too, are
the Orchid House, containing many valuable plants; Gardenia House; and
range of Fig Houses. Covering the back wall of the range of Vineries
before alluded to, and facing the Kitchen Gardens, are the Fruit Rooms,
Mushroom House, Potting Sheds&mdash;also the young men’s rooms: these are
spacious, and contain every convenience for their comfort. Too much credit
cannot be given Mr. Lucas for the manner in which he thus studies the
comfort of his <i>employés</i>, both in this and in other particulars.</p>

<p>The most striking feature in the Kitchen Gardens is the Head Gardener’s
Cottage. This is a picture of architectural beauty, and, from its elevated
position, commands a view of every part of the gardens, as well as most
extensive prospects of the surrounding country. Not only has the external
appearance of this model cottage been made matter of study, but the
interior, also, is replete with every domestic convenience. It is one of
the most charming of residences, and its occupant, Mr. Lucas’s head
gardener, is one of the most accomplished in his profession. To his
good taste and skill much of the beauty and attractiveness of the place
is due.</p>

<p>The north side of these gardens is bounded by a newly planted Orchard,
containing above a hundred fine standard trees of all the best varieties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1287" id="Page_1287">[1287]</a></span>
apples, pears, plums, &amp;c. This is followed by about two acres planted as a
Pinetum, in which are many valuable and promising young specimen coniferæ.
This is continued down to the north carriage drive, where it is bounded by
a belt of evergreen shrubs, &amp;c. It may not be out of place here to add that
the whole of these gardens owe their existence, as well as their present state
of high keeping, to their present estimable owner, who has spared no
expense in their formation or subsequent management, and whose love of
the beautiful, whether in Nature or in Art, is unbounded.</p>

<p>The internal arrangements of the house&mdash;which, besides all the customary
reception and state apartments and the domestic offices, contains an
unusual number of bed-rooms&mdash;are all that can be desired, both for elegance
and for home comforts; and the furnishing and appointments are such as
eminently to entitle Warnham Court to be ranked as a home of taste.
Mr. Lucas is a liberal patron of Art, and both here and at his town
mansion the walls are hung with pictures of matchless excellence and
of great price. They are chiefly by modern, and most of them by
British, artists: a list of them would include nearly all the best painters of
the age.</p>

<p>The park is some three hundred and fifty acres in extent, the farm
occupies about six hundred acres more, and the pleasure-grounds add
another fifty acres to the total, so that Warnham Court is a fine and noble
property, and one unmatched in its district.</p>

<p>It would ill become us, in any notice of the parish of Warnham, to omit
the mention of one of its worthies&mdash;Percy Bysshe Shelley. This ill-fated,
but gifted, poet was born at Field Place, on Broad-bridge Heath, Warnham,
on the 4th of August, 1792. He was the grandson of Sir Bysshe Shelley,
Bart., of Castle Goring, who married twice, and had, by his first wife, with
other issue, a son and successor, Sir Timothy Shelley, who married
Elizabeth, daughter of Charles Pinfold, Esq., of Etchingham, in Surrey:
their eldest son was the poet. Percy Bysshe Shelley received his first
education from the Rev. Mr. Edwards, vicar of Warnham, and was then
sent to school at Brentford, with his young cousin, Thomas Medwin. At
thirteen Shelley was sent to Eton. At eighteen, having previously written
much poetry, he produced his “Queen Mab;” and in 1810 he entered
University College, Oxford. “At the age of nineteen he published a
pamphlet embodying the arguments of Voltaire and the false philosophy
of that school, which was speedily circulated amongst those in authority.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1288" id="Page_1288">[1288]</a></span></p>

         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>View from the North-west.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This reckless act coloured all his subsequent life: it led to his expulsion
from college, to the breaking off of a match with his cousin, and to his
being discarded by his father. Soon afterwards young Shelley married Miss
Westbrook, at Gretna Green, and resided first at Keswick, next in Ireland
(where he published some political pamphlets), and afterwards in Wales.
After three years of married life and the birth of two children, Shelley and
his wife separated in 1814, and he went to Switzerland, where he formed
the friendship of Lord Byron, which closed only with his death. In 1816
he was recalled from Switzerland by the tragic fate of his wife, who committed
suicide by drowning; and shortly afterwards, her father, Mr.
Westbrook, succeeded in an application to deprive him of the guardianship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1289" id="Page_1289">[1289]</a></span>
of his children. Soon after the death of his wife, Shelley married Mary
Wollstonecraft Godwin, daughter of the notorious free-thinker William
Godwin, and herself the authoress of “Frankenstein,” and they settled at
Great Marlow, where he published his “Alastor” and “The Revolt of
Islam.” In 1818 they quitted England for Italy, and from that time to his
death every year “gave evidence of Shelley’s untiring intellectual energy
in the production of numerous poems and other pieces,” including
“Adonais,” “The Cenci,” “Prometheus Bound,” &amp;c. After spending
some time in Rome and Naples and various places, “Mr. and Mrs. Shelley
engaged a house at Lerici, on the Bay of Spezzia, and it was here that he
met his premature and lamented death. On the 8th of July, 1822, he set
sail in his little schooner-yacht, a vessel wholly unfit to encounter the squalls
of the Mediterranean, accompanied by his friend Captain Williams, to meet
Leigh Hunt, who was with Lord Byron at Pisa. A few days afterwards
Shelley left his friends, intending to return with Captain Williams, and set
sail, in spite of the unfavourable change in the weather, with an English
boy, named Charles Vivian, added to the party. They were off Via Reggio,
at some distance from the shore, when a storm was driven over the sea
which enveloped all in darkness; the cloud passed onwards, but the little
schooner had vanished. At the end of a dreadful week of suspense the
worst fears of his friends were confirmed. The body of Shelley was washed
on shore near Via Reggio, that of Captain Williams at a spot about four
miles distant, but that of Charles Vivian was not found for three weeks
afterwards. The bodies were burnt in accordance with the Italian laws
of quarantine, in the presence of Lord Byron and Leigh Hunt, and Shelley’s
ashes were afterwards enclosed in an urn, and deposited in the English
cemetery at Rome, by the side of his infant son William.” “You will have
heard by this time,” says Byron, when writing to Moore on the 2nd of
August, 1822, “that Shelley and another gentleman (Captain Williams)
were drowned about a month ago (a month yesterday), in a squall off the
Gulf of Spezzia. There is thus another man gone about whom the world
was ill-naturedly, and ignorantly, and brutally mistaken. It will perhaps
do him justice <i>now</i>, when he can be no better for it.” Dying before his
father (Sir Timothy), Shelley did not, of course, succeed to the family estates;
but, on the death of Sir Timothy in 1844, the son of the poet succeeded,
and is the present head of the family, Sir Percy Florence Shelley, Bart., of
Field Place, Warnham.</p>

<p>Around Warnham the neighbourhood is one unbroken succession of
pleasant scenery and of delightful “nooks and corners;” and the district is
studded with many pleasant residences. Within a few miles, too, are
Horsham, with its fine old church and other objects of interest; St.
Leonard’s Forest, Longhurst, Graylands, Rusper, and a score or two other
places that are full of beauty and interest, and show well what charms are
furnished by the scenery of Sussex.</p>

<p class="dc16 p4">WHETHER from its own nobleness of character, the innate beauty
and loveliness of its situation, the magnificence and even sublimity
of its surroundings, the grandeur and sumptuous richness
of its appointments, the extent of its domains, the historical incidents
with which it is connected, the interesting and stirring events which
have been associated with its history, or the true nobility of character
of its long line of illustrious owners, Lowther Castle may indeed be classed
as one of the finest, most important, and most stately of the “Stately
Homes” of this favoured land of ours. Situate in one of the most lovely
of shires&mdash;Westmoreland&mdash;and surrounded on all sides by the most
magnificent of scenery, Lowther is indeed a “favoured spot”&mdash;a spot
where Nature has been profuse in her gifts, and where Art has found a
fitting shrine. Here</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“hills on hills, on forests forests rise;</p>
<p class="pp6">Spurn the low earth, and mingle with the skies.”</p>

<p class="pn1">Mountain and dale, hill and valley, fell and lake, moor and meadow, wood
and stream, are spread around in such lavish profusion that the eye wanders
on from one to another in constant change of scene, and the mind vainly
endeavours to grasp their varied beauties. Its situation is, indeed, a scene
of loveliness not easily conceived, and which but few “earthly Edens”
surpass.</p>

<p>The castle itself, as it now stands, is modern; but it was erected on the
site of an older mansion, belonging to the same family, which was taken
down by Sir John Lowther in 1685, who enlarged and rebuilt it on a
scale of much magnificence. The greater part of this second building,
Lowther Hall as it was called, was destroyed by fire in 1720, the wings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1292" id="Page_1292">[1292]</a></span>
only being left standing; but these were sufficient “to show the ancient
magnitude and grandeur of this formerly noble structure.” In 1808 Lord
Lonsdale, whose predecessor for very many years had been making preparations
by cutting down timber and collecting together materials for the
work, commenced the erection of the present edifice. In January, 1808,
the first stone was laid, and by the summer of 1809 a portion of the
mansion was inhabited by the family. This new structure, which is of
castellated character, was dignified by the name of “Lowther Castle,” in
place of the old designation of “Hall.” It was erected from the designs
of Sir Robert Smirke, at an enormous cost, and is considered to be his
<i>chef-d’œuvre</i> in that style of architecture, in which, however, he was not at
all times happy. The north front is thoroughly castellated in its style, the
south more ornate and ecclesiastical in its character; the whole, however,
from whichever side it is seen, or from whatever point a glimpse is obtained,
has a picturesque appearance and an air of princely magnificence about it
that are eminently striking and pleasing to the eye.</p>

<p>Lowther Castle stands in a grand old well-wooded park of some six
or eight hundred acres. In front, at a little distance, runs the lovely
river Lowther, with its rocky bed and its wildly romantic banks; at the
back (the south front) are the Lawns and the Deer Park; to the west are
the Terrace and Pleasure Gardens and wooded walks; and to the east the
Stables, Kitchen Gardens, and village.</p>

<p>The family of Lowther, of which the present Earl of Lonsdale is the
noble head, is of considerable antiquity in the border counties of Westmoreland
and Cumberland.</p>

<p>The names of William and Thomas Lowther appear as witnesses to
a grant as early as the reign of Henry II., and in the reign of Henry III.
were Sir Thomas de Lowther, Knight, Sir Gervase de Lowther, Knight, and
Gervase de Lowther, Archdeacon of Carlisle. Succeeding them was Sir
Hugh de Lowther, Knight, who was Attorney-General in 1292, represented
the county in 1300 and 1305, became Justice-Itinerant and Escheator in
Eyre north of the Trent; and was in 1331 made one of the Justices of
King’s Bench. Sir Hugh married a daughter of Sir Peter Tilliol, Knight,
and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Hugh Lowther.</p>

<p>This Sir Hugh was married twice: first, to a daughter of Lord Lucy, of
Cockermouth; and, secondly, to Margaret, daughter of William de Quale.
At his death, after serving in many important offices, he was succeeded by
his son(?) Sir Robert Lowther, Knight, who died in 1490, leaving issue
by his wife, Margaret Strickland, a son, Sir Hugh, who succeeded him, and
three daughters, married respectively to Sir Thomas Curwen, Sir James
Pickering, and William Lancaster.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1294" id="Page_1294">[1294]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Hugh de Lowther married Margaret, daughter of John de Derwentwater,
by whom he left, with other issue, his son and successor, Sir
Hugh de Lowther, Knight, who represented the county of Cumberland.
He married Mabel, daughter of Sir William Lancaster, of Sockbridge, by
whom he had a son and heir, Sir Hugh de Lowther, Knight of the Bath,
who married Anne, daughter of Sir Launcelot Threlkeld, and died <i>circa</i>
1511.</p>

<p>Sir John de Lowther, his eldest son, succeeded him, and having married
Lucy, daughter of Sir Thomas Curwen, of Workington, had issue by her
a son, Sir Hugh, who, having married Dorothy, daughter of Henry, Lord
Clifford, had issue as follows:&mdash;Sir Richard Lowther, who succeeded to the
estates (of whom presently); Gerard Lowther, a bencher of Lincoln’s Inn;
Margaret Lowther, married to John Richmond, Esq., of Highead Castle;
Anne, married to Thomas Wybergh, Esq., of Clifton; Frances, married to
Sir Henry Goodyer, Knight of Powlesworth; and Barbara, married to
Thomas Carleton, of Carleton. Sir Hugh, dying during his father’s lifetime,
the estates passed to his eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir Richard Lowther, Knight, who succeeded his cousin, Henry Lord
Scrope, as Lord Warden of the West Marches. Sir Richard “was three
times commissioner in the great affairs between England and Scotland under
Elizabeth.” He had also the unfortunate and ill-fated Mary Queen of
Scots under his charge, and conveyed her to Carlisle. He died in 1607,
leaving with other issue, by his wife, Frances, daughter of John Middleton,
Esq., four sons&mdash;viz. Sir Christopher (of whom presently); Sir Gerard
Lowther, Chief Justice of Common Pleas and Lord Chancellor of Ireland;
Sir Launcelot Lowther, Knight, a Baron of the Exchequer in Ireland;
and William Lowther, Esq., of Ingleton.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher Lowther was knighted by King James at Newcastle-on-Tyne.
He married Eleanor, daughter of Sir William Musgrave, of
Hayton, by whom he had a family of eight sons and four daughters. He
was succeeded by his son, Sir John Lowther, M.P. for Westmoreland
(married to Eleanor, daughter of William Fleming, of Rydal), who, dying
in 1637, was in turn succeeded by his son, Sir John Lowther, M.P. for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1295" id="Page_1295">[1295]</a></span>
same county, who was created a baronet in 1640. Dying in 1675, he was
succeeded by his grandson, Sir John Lowther, who was “the thirty-first
knight of the family in nearly direct succession.” In 1689 he was made
Lord-Lieutenant of Westmoreland and Cumberland, and the following year
appointed First Commissioner of the Treasury. In 1696 Sir John was
created Baron Lowther of Lowther and Viscount Lonsdale, and, in 1698,
was made Lord Privy Seal, and held many other offices. Dying in 1700,
he was succeeded in his titles and estates by his son&mdash;</p>

<p>Richard, second Viscount Lonsdale, who died in 1713, when the titles
and estates devolved on his brother Henry, third Viscount Lonsdale, at
whose death the barony of Lowther and viscountcy of Lonsdale ceased, the
estates and baronetcy devolving upon his great-nephew, Sir James Lowther,
eldest son of Robert Lowther, Esq., Governor of Barbadoes.</p>

<p>Sir James was M.P. for Cumberland and Westmoreland. In 1782
he offered to build and completely to furnish at his own expense a man-of-war
of seventy guns, but the coming peace rendered this unnecessary.
Sir James was, in 1784, created Baron Lowther of Lowther, Viscount
Lowther, and Earl of Lonsdale. He married a daughter of the Earl of
Bute, but, having no issue by her, his lordship, in 1797, obtained a new
patent, creating him Baron and Viscount Lowther, with remainder to the
heirs male of his cousin, the Rev. Sir William Lowther, Bart., of Swillington.
Dying in 1802, the earldom and other titles of the first creation became
extinct, those of the second patent descending to Sir William Lowther, who
thus became Baron Lowther and Viscount Lowther, and was, in 1807,
created Earl of Lonsdale. His lordship married the Lady Augusta Fane,
daughter of John, ninth Earl of Westmoreland, by whom he had issue&mdash;William,
Viscount Lowther, by whom he was succeeded; the Hon. Henry
Cecil Lowther, M.P.; the Lady Elizabeth Lowther, who died unmarried;
the Lady Mary Lowther, who married Major-general Lord Frederick
Cavendish-Bentinck, third son of the third Duke of Portland, and was
mother of Mr. G. A. F. Cavendish-Bentinck, M.P. for Whitehaven; the
Lady Anne Lowther, married to the Right Hon. Sir John Beckett, Bart.;
and the Lady Caroline Lowther, married to Lord William John Frederick
Poulett, son of the Duke of Cleveland. Dying in 1844, the Earl was
succeeded by his eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>William, second Earl of Lonsdale, Viscount and Baron Lowther, and a
baronet, who had been summoned to the House of Peers during his father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1296" id="Page_1296">[1296]</a></span>
lifetime as Baron Lowther. He had sat as M.P. for various places from
1801 to 1841, and, among other appointments, successively held those of a
Lord of the Admiralty, a Lord of the Treasury, First Commissioner of
Woods and Forests, Treasurer of the Navy, Vice-President of the Board
of Trade, Postmaster-General, and President of Council. His lordship
died unmarried on the 4th of March, 1872, and was succeeded by his
nephew&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry Lowther, as third Earl of Lonsdale and Viscount and Baron
Lowther of Whitehaven, of the second creation, who was the son of Colonel
the Hon. Henry Cecil Lowther (second son of the first earl, by Lady Lucy,
daughter of the fifth Earl of Harborough). He was born on the 27th of
March, 1818, and succeeded his uncle at his death in 1872. His lordship
was educated at Westminster and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he
took the degree of M.A. in 1838. He was appointed cornet and sub-lieutenant
in the 1st Life Guards in 1841, became lieutenant in 1843,
captain in 1849, and retired in 1854. For twenty-four years he retained
the confidence of the electors of West Cumberland, sitting uninterruptedly
for this division from 1847 to 1872, when he succeeded his uncle in the
title and estates. The seat thus vacant by the late earl’s accession to the
House of Lords was obtained without a contest by Lord Muncaster. His
lordship was Lord-Lieutenant and <i>Custos Rotulorum</i> of Cumberland and
Westmoreland, a magistrate for Rutland, Hon. Colonel of the Royal
Cumberland Militia and of the Cumberland Rifle Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel
of the Westmoreland and Cumberland Yeomanry Cavalry, and a
member of the Carlton, Boodle’s, Jockey, and Turf Clubs. Lord Lonsdale
married, in 1852, Emily Susan, daughter of St. George Francis
Caulfield, Esq., of Dunamon Castle, county Roscommon, by whom he left
issue living four sons and two daughters. These are&mdash;St. George Henry
Lowther, the present Earl of Lonsdale; the Hon. Hugh Cecil Lowther,
born in 1857; the Hon. Charles Edwin Lowther, born in 1859; the Hon.
Lancelot Edward Lowther, born in 1867; the Lady Sybil Emily Lowther;
and the Lady Verena Maud Lowther. His lordship died somewhat
suddenly on the 15th of August, 1876, and was buried the Saturday
following in Lowther Church.</p>

<p>The present noble head of the House of Lowther, St. George Henry, fourth
Earl of Lonsdale and Viscount and Baron Lowther of Whitehaven, and a
baronet, was born on the 4th of October, 1855, and therefore succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1297" id="Page_1297">[1297]</a></span>
to the titles and estates a few weeks before attaining his majority. His
lordship was, in 1875, appointed Sub-Lieutenant of the Royal Cumberland
Militia, and shortly afterwards transferred to the Nottingham Royal Sherwood
Rangers. He is patron of forty-three livings&mdash;viz. Aikton, Armathwaite,
Bootle, Bolton, Bowness, Brigham, Buttermere, Cockermouth, Cleator, Corney,
Distingdon, Embleton, Gosforth, Hensingham, Haile, Kirkandrews-upon-Eden,
Kirkbride, Lorton, Loweswater, Moresby, Mosser, St. Bees,
Threlkeld, Whicham, Whitbeck, St. James, Christchurch, St. Nicholas,
and Holy Trinity, Whitehaven; Askham, Bampton, Barton, Kirkby
Stephen, Lowther, Patterdale, Clifton, Ravenstonedale, Shap, Startforth
(Yorkshire), Bampton Kirk, Orton, St. John’s-in-the-Vale, and Crosthwaite.</p>

<p>The arms of the Earl of Lonsdale are&mdash;<i>or</i>, six
annulets, three, two, and one, <i>sable</i>. Crest, a dragon,
<i>argent</i>. Supporters, two horses, <i>argent</i>, gorged with
wreaths of laurel, <i>vert</i>. His seats are Lowther Castle,
Westmoreland; Whitehaven Castle, Cumberland;

House Terrace, London.</p>

<p>Lowther Castle is entered by a massive porch in the
centre of its north front, the door, which is garnished
with magnificent bronze knockers, giving access to the grand Entrance Hall.
This is a noble Gothic apartment, some sixty feet long by thirty feet in width,
ceiled with panelled oak. The entrance doorway is in the centre of the north
side, and immediately in front is the Grand Staircase, across the landing
of which is a noble arcade of three lofty pointed archways rising from
clustered columns. From the angled corners of the Hall doorways open to
passages leading to the domestic offices. At each end of this fine apartment,
and again in front of each pillar between and adjoining the flights of stairs,
are suits of ancient armour standing on lofty pedestals, ranges of the old
“Black Bess” guns of the old Cumberland Militia and other trophies of
arms decorating the walls.</p>

<p>The Grand Staircase, sixty feet square and ninety feet in height, leads
up from the Entrance Hall to the various suites of apartments. It is entirely
of stone, and has a richly groined ceiling rising from clustered columns.
Facing the entrance, on the first landing, is a magnificent vase, and in
canopied niches in the wall are exquisitely sculptured figures, the arms of
Lowther and the alliances of the family also appropriately decorating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1298" id="Page_1298">[1298]</a></span>
walls. The Staircase is of four heights, the upper forming a triforium
passage, over which are windows filled with rich Gothic tracery and stained
glass. The centre of the elaborately groined ceiling is panelled, and bears
the inscription: “+ Edif<sup>t</sup>. Cul<sup>s</sup>. Com. de Lonsdale an<sup>o</sup>. Regni L<sup>o</sup>. R<sup>s</sup>.
Geo<sup>i</sup>. III. A<sup>o</sup>. D<sup>i</sup>. MDCCCX: cur<sup>e</sup>. Rob<sup>o</sup>. Smirke.” Arms and banners
decorate the walls, and plants and flowers, arranged to line the staircases in
every direction, add immeasurably to the beauty and the comfort as well
as to the stateliness of this fine portion of the edifice.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to enter fully into a description of the various
apartments of this noble residence; they are all sumptuous in their
furnishing, admirable in their appointments, and replete with everything
that can make a “home of taste” enjoyable. Some of the apartments,
however, require special notice, and to each of these we proceed to devote a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1299" id="Page_1299">[1299]</a></span>
few lines&mdash;not taking them in any given order, but as we saw them on our
recent visit.</p>

<p>Passing to the second landing through an “ante-room to the sleeping
apartments,” in which are preserved a valuable and extensive collection of
Ceramics arranged in glass cases, and also a number of antiquities, are the
State Bed-room and its suite of dressing-rooms. These are all hung with
remarkably fine Gobelins tapestry. These noble apartments occupy the
space in the centre of the south front, and from the windows are lovely
views of the Grounds and Deer Park. The state bed, which is hung with
white satin richly embroidered, is of black and gold, the massive cornice,
solidly gilt, being surrounded by angels, five on each side and four at the
foot, and reminding one of the charming nursery rhyme of our childish
days:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Four corners to my bed,<br />
Four angels round me spread;<br />
One to sing, and one to pray,<br />
And two to carry my soul away!”</p>

<p class="pn1">The appointments of the room are of the most sumptuous character, the
toilet service of silver gilt adding much to its magnificence.</p>

<p>On the landing of the Grand Staircase, among other Art treasures are
Lawrence’s full-length portrait of George IV., Greenhill’s Walpole,
Kneller’s Duke of Marlborough, Addison, and other paintings; and in the
east ante-room leading to the sleeping apartments in that part of the castle
are various objects of note.</p>

<p>On the first or ground floor landing of the Grand Staircase, to the right,
between the private apartments, is a corridor leading to various rooms, and
to the left a similar corridor, from which open the Library and other apartments,
leads to the Gallery of Worthies, and gives access to the Sculpture
Gallery; it has a groined ceiling, and contains a large and powerful organ,
wall-cases of books, and some valuable paintings and busts.</p>

<p>The Library is in the north front, and is a noble and well-appointed
room, fitted in a style of quiet sumptuousness that is in full accord with the
rich collection of rare literary treasures with which the walls are lined.
The ceiling is of panelled oak of suitable Gothic character, heightened
with gold, and the presses for books are also of oak richly adorned with
cinquefoil cusps. Besides its literary treasures, the Library is hung with a
fine collection of family portraits of surpassing interest. These are
(beginning at the north-east corner of the apartment)&mdash;Sir John Lowther, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1300" id="Page_1300">[1300]</a></span>
Lowther, Bart., 1657; Sir John Lowther, <i>fils</i>, 1675; James, Earl of
Lonsdale, known as “the eccentric earl;” Sir Christopher Lowther, Bart.;
Eleanor, wife of Sir John Lowther; Henry, third Viscount Lonsdale;
Richard, second Viscount Lonsdale; Sir John Lowther, Bart.; Hon.
Anthony Lowther; Jane, wife of Sir John Lowther; Rev. Sir William
Lowther, Bart.; Sir James Lowther, Bart.; Robert Lowther, Esq.; Sir
John Lowther, Bart.; and William, Earl of Lonsdale, K.G. Among other
objects of interest preserved in this room is a table formed of the wood of
one of the piles of old London Bridge, with a small portion of the “Abdication
Tree” of Napoleon inserted. It bears this inscription, “Made out of
one of the piles supporting the chapel arch of London Bridge. Supposed
date, 1176. The gift of John Rennie, architect, 1829.” “Le cinq d’avril
dix-huit cent quatorze Napoleon Bonaparte signa son abdication sur cette
table dans le cabinet de travail du Roi, le 2<sup>me</sup> après la chambre à coucher
à Fontainebleau.” “Wilkinson &amp; Sons, 14, Ludgate Hill, 6881.”</p>

<p>The Billiard-room, not on account of any architectural features or of the
use to which it is assigned, but from the remarkably interesting character
of the collection of pictures contained within its walls, is one of the most
important features of the castle. Its walls are hung with portraits of
“Westmoreland Worthies,” forming a gallery of celebrities of which not
only the county, but the nation may indeed well be proud, and the founding
of which is a lasting honour to the House of Lowther. Well indeed would
it be if the example of forming local Galleries of Worthies, so nobly set by
the second Earl of Lonsdale, were followed by the Lords-Lieutenant
of other counties whose high functions and important positions point
them out especially as the right parties to honour native worth, and
their mansions as the right and proper and only place in which such
a gallery should be enshrined. The collection of “Westmoreland Worthies”
at Lowther Castle is a noble beginning in the right direction,
and it is to be hoped the spirit and feeling that caused its foundation
by one of the noble heads of the House of Lowther may still actuate his
successors, and cause what is now a glorious nucleus to become a full and
complete collection. The portraits at present contained in this gallery
are&mdash;Queen Catherine Parr, wife of Henry VIII., born at Kendal Castle;
Christopher Baynbrigg, Cardinal of St. Praxede, Legate to the Court of
Rome, Archbishop of York, Master of the Rolls, &amp;c.; George Clifford, Earl
of Cumberland; Sir Gerard Lowther, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1301" id="Page_1301">[1301]</a></span>
Common Pleas, Ireland; the Marquis of Wharton; the Right Hon. Joseph
Addison; John, First Viscount Lonsdale; the Hon. Justice Wilson; Sir
Alan Chambre; Dr. Burn, LL.D., the historian of Westmoreland and
Cumberland, and author of the “Justice of the Peace;” Lord Langdale;
Alderman Thompson, Lord Mayor of London; Sir George Fleming, Bishop
of Carlisle; Gibson, Bishop of London; John Bell, Chancery barrister;
Richard Braithwaite, author of the “English Gentleman,” &amp;c.; Dean
Addison; Dr. Shaw; Waugh, Bishop of Carlisle; Duke of Wharton;
Admiral Sir Charles Richardson; John Langhorne, D.D.; Watson, Bishop
of Llandaff; Bernard Gilpin; General Bowser; Thomas Barlow; William
Hogarth, whose ancestors belonged to the county; Dr. Fothergill; the
Countess of Pembroke, who once wrote, when pressed to put in a court
candidate for the borough of Appleby, “Sir, I have been bullied by an
usurper, I have been neglected by a court, but I will not be dictated to
by a subject. Your man shan’t stand;” Admiral Pearson, famous for
his engagement with Paul Jones; John Robinson, Surveyor-General of
Woods and Forests, who is represented holding in his hand a “Report of
Acorns planted in and about Windsor Great Park,” &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>It may be named <i>en passant</i> that in various parts of the castle are a
number of paintings&mdash;supposed to be veritable Hogarths&mdash;which were
brought from the old Vauxhall Gardens.</p>

<p>The Drawing-room, opposite the Library, is a lovely apartment&mdash;the walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1302" id="Page_1302">[1302]</a></span>
hung with costly figured satin, the ceiling richly groined in elaborate fan-tracery,
and the furniture as sumptuous and elegant as the most exquisite
and fastidious taste could desire, or the most lavish expenditure procure.
Among the furniture is a magnificent suite of couch, chairs, and stools,
which are of historic interest; they belonged to Tippoo Sahib, and are
marvels of Indian Art workmanship in ivory and gold. It is not, however,
our province to speak in detail of any of the appointments or furnishing
of the rooms; all we can say is that the Drawing-room and other apartments
are rich storehouses of exquisite gems of loveliness, such as one might
naturally expect would characterize a home presided over by a lady of such
pure taste and such high accomplishments as the present Countess of
Lonsdale. We must, however, casually allude to one literary treasure
which is kept in the Drawing-room&mdash;an album in which have been written
by their own hands, at various times when visiting Lowther, poetical or
prose contributions by Sir Walter Scott, William Wordsworth, Robert
Southey (13th October, 1824), Samuel Rogers (January 23rd, 1826), the
Duke of Wellington (January 2nd, 1829), Sir Humphry Davy (Sept. 11th,
1826), Hon. G. O’Callagan, Amelia Opie, and others; while it is also
graced by original drawings made on its pages by Dewint, Page, Sir
George Beaumont, Lady Anne Beckett, Lady Delamere, Lady Farnborough,
Lady F. Bentinck, the Marchioness of Stafford, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Saloon, in the centre of the south front, has a Gothic panelled
ceiling, and contains many fine paintings by Zuccarelli, Guido, Elisabetta
Sirani, &amp;c., and (as well as other parts of the house) some grand old china.
The Dining-room has two fine paintings&mdash;Pitt, by Hoppner, and Wellington,
by Jackson; and in the centre of the gorgeous display of gold plate on the
buffet is a full-sized silver-gilt copy of Flaxman’s <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>, the Shield
of Achilles.</p>

<p>The Countess’s or Breakfast Room contains some of the richest treasures
of Art in the castle. Among them are the Wakes, the Feast, and the Fête
Champêtre of Teniers; a Holy Family of Rubens; and marvellously fine
examples of Vandyke, Fyt, Wouvermans, Leonardo da Vinci, Gerard
Douw, FrankHals, Ruysdael, Borgognone, Rembrandt, Jan Steen, Bischey,
Sassoferrato, Titian, and others.</p>

<p>The Picture Gallery, with its glass ceiling, is a noble room, filled with
pictures of high merit, many being <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i> of the various artists. It
will be sufficient to say that it contains, among others, no less than ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1303" id="Page_1303">[1303]</a></span>
Snyders of large size and of almost unmatched excellence (the only others
we know of equal or more excellence being those at Welbeck), and
admirable examples of Tintoretti, Titian (a remarkably fine picture), Guido,
Paolo Veronese, Paris Bordone, Luca Giordano, Backhuysen, Zuccarelli,
Hogarth, Bernardo Canaletto, Poussin, Carlo Cignani, Salvator Rosa,
Bordenone, Lely (a nude Nell Gwynne, which contrasts very unfavourably
with the Titian on the same walls), Paul Bril, Bronzino, Bassano, Fyt,
Delia Nottie, Murillo, Zucchero, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The other apartments, beautiful as they all undoubtedly are, and filled
as they are with choice works of Art, are not necessary to be named.
There are, however, two of the most important features of Lowther yet
to be noticed. These are the two Sculpture Galleries and the passages
and corridors leading to them. To these we proceed to direct brief
attention.</p>

important assemblage of Roman inscribed stones&mdash;altars, monumental
stones, inscriptions of cohorts, &amp;c.&mdash;from the Roman wall and from the old
stations in the three counties; mediæval sculptures from the neighbourhood;
and a number of Celtic and Roman urns and other antiquities of more than

his prostrate foe; another stone, bearing much the same design as the last,
but in a more complete state; a fir-cone; a female head; and a lion overpowering
a ram. From Plumpton, or Old Penrith, a remarkably fine
sepulchral inscribed stone, bearing a figure, probably intended to represent
a deceased child. He is dressed in a tunic, and holds in his left hand a
whip, and in his right a kind of toy. The inscription is&mdash;</p>

<p>It has with reason been attributed to
Praxiteles; and it is believed to be the work alluded to by Lucian and
Pliny as one of the triumphs of Greek Art&mdash;a belief which obtains force
with all Art-lovers by whom it has been seen. There are also a statue of
Diana, of exceeding grace and beauty; a Statue of Julius Caesar, half life-size,
seated in a consular chair, and of fine conception; the upper half of a
seated female figure, draped, brought to England by Lord Guildford, and
the only specimen brought home by him&mdash;a great work, certainly a production
of the best era of Greece, and a majestic, yet tender creation; a
statue of Agrippina, of rare excellence, from the Stowe collection; a torso
of a Venus, from the Marquis of Hertford’s collection&mdash;a work of refined
delicacy, yet exhibiting intense power; a statue of Bacchus, a relic of great
worth; a beautiful statue of Hygeia, from the Besborough collection&mdash;a
work of pure Art, originally from the Capitol; a Roman sarcophagus, from
the same collection, with Cupids hunting in relief; a monument from the
Besborough collection, inscribed “Honos est præmium virtutis,” and several
other sarcophagi and monuments; a rich example of moulding from the
Palace of the Cæsars; a figure of Mars; some vases; statues of Marcus
Aurelius, Bacchus, Agrippina, and Diana; busts of Livia, Trajan, Janus,
Cato, Vitellius, Nero, Sylla, Seneca, Plato, Marcus Pompeius, Galba,
Agrippina, Faustina, Matidia, Homer, Nerva, the Cæsars, and Æsculapius;
and a bronze statue of Hercules.</p>

<p>There are also some fine stone chairs, an Egyptian bath, statues of Pan,
Augustus, a roman Senator, Hygeia, Euterpe, Flora, Cybele, Adonis, Paris,
the Water-carrier, Sphinx, Cicero, Aristides, &amp;c.; and “the Olympian
Meta, brought from Greece by the Emperor Nero, and placed in the circus
at Rome.” It was purchased by the Marquis of Hertford, and was formerly
in his collection. It now forms one of the more interesting features of
the Lowther Gallery.</p>

of which was copied for one of the Earls of Lonsdale to be interred in)

     <p class="pc"><i>In the Grounds of Lowther Castle.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Grounds and Gardens of Lowther Castle are among its most glorious
and charming attractions. Nature has done much for it in the beauty of its
situation and the majestic character of its surroundings; and the purest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1312" id="Page_1312">[1312]</a></span>
taste in Art, allied to the most consummate skill, has taken advantage of
those natural beauties, and added charm upon charm to the place. On the
west front are lawns (divided from the Deer Park by a sunk fence) laid out
tastefully in beds rich in their profusion of colours. At the west end of the
mansion is the Conservatory, and near, but below it, approached by a flight
of steps from the Terrace, is the Countess’s Garden. The site of this
exquisitely lovely spot is a natural dell, and its sloping sides are turfed and
planted, while the centre is somewhat elaborately, and with faultless taste,
laid out in geometrical form, and filled with the choicest and richest of
flowers; the disposition of the vases, the arrangement of the beds, and the
harmonious blending of the colour showing the purest taste and a high
order of skill on the part of the head-gardener, to whom it owes its origin.
Near this is the Yew Avenue&mdash;a walk densely covered in by the intertwined
branches and foliage of the rows of yew-trees, hundreds of years old,
which range along its sides. From here pathways lead on to the Terrace
outside the wood.</p>

<p>Of the Terrace it is impossible to convey an idea. It is simply a
tract of high land, thickly wooded with the finest of forest trees and the
most majestic of conifers, around the outer edge of which runs a broad
grassy walk or drive, commanding almost a panorama of the finest of views
that even this district of marvellous scenery can produce. From here, in
one direction, is Knipe Scar, rising above the village of Bampton; and behind
it, again, are Swindale, Walla Crag, beneath which is the lovely lake of
Haweswater, and above these, again, rise Harter Fell and High Street (over
which runs the old Roman road). Then the hamlet of Helton, and further
to the right Helvellyn and other mountains above Ulleswater. Again,
there is Askham, with the heights of Blencathra or Saddleback, and the
mountains in the Keswick district; while through the Park, far down
below, runs the river Lowther, whose murmurs over its rocky bed are
distinctly audible. In the wood which skirts the Terrace are some gigantic
conifers and other trees which are “great among the greatest.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1313" id="Page_1313">[1313]</a></span></p>

<p>The Kitchen Gardens, at some distance from the mansion, are well
arranged, very extensive (about seven acres), and extremely productive;
and their pleasing effect is much heightened by the judicious introduction of
richly arranged flower borders: the glass houses of all kinds are of great
extent.</p>

<p>At a little distance across the park is Lowther Church, with the family
Mausoleum in its churchyard. The Mausoleum, upon which the gifted
poet, the Rev. James Dixon, wrote the following stanza&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“A grander, fairer spot of English ground</p>
<p class="pp7">To rest in till the trump of doom shall blow<br />
From the high heavens through land and sea below,</p>
<p class="pp6">In all this ancient realm could not be found.<br />
Sheer from beneath, the river’s amber flood,</p>
<p class="pp7">Breaking in white waves ‘gainst the stony shores,<br />
Round this green eminence for ever pours</p>
<p class="pp6">The loud voice of its waters, through the wood<br />
That clothes its banks, and crowns the airy hills</p>
<p class="pp7">And verdant slopes of Lowther’s wide domain,<br />
Swelling and falling with the grand refrain</p>
<p class="pp6">Of Nature’s voice omnipotent. What heart but thrills</p>
<p class="pp7">To these wild charms, lit by the vernal beams,<br />
Grey wood, green lawn, and river’s dancing gleams?”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="pn1">is a plain Gothic building, containing in its upper room a finely sculptured
figure, by Stephens, of “William, Earl of Lonsdale,” 1863. The Church
possesses some good Norman features which are worthy of careful examination,
and many interesting monuments to the Lowther family. Among
these may be named the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the north transept a large altar tomb to William, first Earl of
Lonsdale of the second creation, who died March 19th, 1844; and Augusta,
his countess (daughter of John, ninth Earl of Westmoreland), who died
March 6th, 1838. Here, too, was buried the late third Earl, who died in
August, 1876. There are also tablets to the memory of James, first Earl
of Lonsdale, 1802, and his countess, Mary, daughter of John, Earl of
Bute, 1824; and to Richard, Lord Lonsdale; and brasses to Colonel the
Hon. Henry Cecil Lowther (father of the late earl), 1867; and to Lucy
Eleanor, his wife, daughter of Philip, fifth Earl of Harborough, 1848; and
to the Hon. Arthur Lowther, their son, 1855.</p>

<p>In the south transept are a remarkably finely sculptured monument with
a reclining figure to the memory of John, Viscount Lonsdale and Baron
Lowther, 1700, and Catherine, his countess; and other noble monuments to
Sir John Lowther, 1637; Sir John, 1675; and Lord William Frederick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1314" id="Page_1314">[1314]</a></span>
Cavendish-Bentinck, who married the Hon. Mary Lowther, 1828. In the
same transept is a recumbent effigy in plate armour, over which is a tablet
of remarkable character, bearing a family pedigree. This almost unique
example of inscription is as follows, each item being, on the tablet, enclosed
in squares, which, however, we have not followed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq">“S<sup>r</sup> Rich: Lowther Knig: succeded Hen: Lo<sup>d</sup>: Scroope in ye office of Lo Warden of y<sup>e</sup> West Marches, &amp; was

verses followinge”</p>

<p class="p1">Beneath this inscription is a plain black tablet let into the stone, which
has, there can be no doubt, at one time borne, or been intended to bear, the
verses. It is now quite black and plain, so that the “verses” Sir Richard
was “vttring at his last breth” are literally “blank verse.”</p>

<p>In the south aisle are tablets to Colonel Lowther (grandfather of the
present Earl of Londale), 1867, and Lucy Eleanor Shorard, his wife, 1848;
to Elizabeth, second daughter of William, Earl of Lonsdale, 1869; to Mary,
third daughter of the same earl, and widow of Lord Frederick Bentinck,
1863; and to Anne, fourth daughter of the same, and widow of Sir John
Beekett of Sowerby, 1871.</p>

<p>From Lowther Church a delightful path leads by the side of the river
Lowther to Askham Bridge, near which are the village Church, the
charming Rectory-house, and Askham Hall, a noble old Border stronghold,
now the residence of the Rev. Dr. Jackson, the respected and venerable
Provost of Queen’s College and Rector of Lowther. Few spots in the
whole district can compare in loveliness with Askham Bridge. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1315" id="Page_1315">[1315]</a></span>
rocky bed of the river&mdash;flat table rock, full of deep wide cracks&mdash;the
masses of stone hurled down upon its surface, the rich green and brown of
its water, the number of fish seen disporting among the rocks, and the rich,
deeply tinted, and massive foliage by which the whole is overhung, form a
picture of faultless loveliness.</p>

<p>Of the district around Lowther we cannot say more than a few brief
words. It is, as we have already observed, a district rich in natural
beauties of mountain and lake, of hill and valley, of wood and river;
but it is also equally rich in places of historic interest and in objects of
antiquarian importance. The whole of the Lake district, including the two
counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland, is, indeed, one grand storehouse
of places of note, and objects to which attention is worthy to be drawn. It
is only of a few that we can speak.</p>

<p>Penrith, one of the oldest towns of the district, with its ruined castle, its
beacon, its “giant’s grave” and other Danish or Saxon remains, its famous
old grammar school, its interesting church, its plague record,[A] and its
altar-piece, the exquisite work of Jacob Thompson; Clifton, memorable as
the scene of the battle of Clifton Moor, and where the old border stronghold,
the house where the Duke of Cumberland slept, and the oak-tree under
which the slain were buried, are still pointed out; Eamont Bridge, where
“A welcome into Cumberland” is held out as the sign of the inn on crossing
the river into that county, and close by which are the curious earth-works of
“King Arthur’s Round Table” and “Mayborough;” Brougham Castle, a
grand old ruined fortress, on the site of the Roman station <i>Broconiacum</i>, and
the place from which Lord Brougham derives his title; Brougham Hall,
“the Windsor of the North,” the seat of Lord Brougham and Vaux, a fine
castellated mansion, with a glorious chapel, full to repletion with Art-work
of costly and elaborate character; the famous stone circle “Long Meg and
her daughters,” three hundred and fifty yards in circumference; Dacre
Castle, a grand old fortress, whose owners fought at the siege of Acre under
Cœur de Lion, and thus named their own stronghold now in ruins; Eden
Hall, famous as the hall where is preserved the goblet called the “Luck of
Eden Hall,” about which hangs so much traditional mystery, and the prophetic
import of the couplet&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“If that glass should break or fall,<br />
Farewell the luck of Eden Hall”&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1316" id="Page_1316">[1316]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">is implicitly believed in; Askham, of which we have already spoken; Greystoke
Castle, where “Belted Will” Howard and his wife, “Bessie with the
braid apron,” lived; Shap, with its ruined abbey; Ulleswater, the grandest
of lakes&mdash;wild, lovely, and beautiful, with its banks at its more sylvan end
here and there studded with charming villas; Sharrow Bay, a “home of
taste,” the seat of Anthony Parkin, Esq., where Art is more happily wedded
to Nature than is usually the case, and where the views of the lake are more
charming than from any other point; Lyulph’s Tower; Haweswater, another
exquisite lake; Hackthorpe, rich in antiquarian interest, but rendered for
all time famous as the residence of one of the most gifted sons of Art, Jacob
Thompson,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> from whose easel at the “Hermitage” emanate those marvellous
conceptions which have created for him his “name and fame for all time;”
Lowther village, planned in military style, and with adjoining battery;
Bampton, Helton, and a score or two other places&mdash;these are not a tithe of
the attractions which the immediate neighbourhood of Lowther Castle presents,
and which are all easily visited by the stranger. Thanks to the
railway companies&mdash;to the Midland more especially, by the formation of its
Settle and Carlisle line&mdash;the Lake district is opened out to the world, and is
able to be visited with real pleasure, with economy of time, with immense
benefit, and with perfect comfort. By the line to which we have alluded
the traveller passes along the side of one of the loftiest of the whole ranges
of mountains, and sees the country mapped out beneath him in rich profusion
of wood and meadow and stream, the towns and villages dotted about
here and there, and the becks and streams, the tarns and lakes, the rocks
and mountains, opened out before him, charmingly diversified and rendered
rich in colouring by the ever-changing atmosphere. From London, without
change, all this can be reached by the Settle and Carlisle route, and the
visitor may thus in a few brief hours be transported from the busy town
life of the metropolis into the very heart of the most lovely scenery the world
can produce.</p>

<p class="dc13 p4">CLUMBER, the seat of his Grace the Duke of Newcastle, is
charmingly situated within about four miles from Worksop,
and on the borders of Sherwood Forest. The drive from
Worksop, up Sparkin Hill, and so along the highway for the
forest, is lovely in the extreme, the road being well wooded on
either side, and presenting glimpses of forest scenery that are
peculiarly grateful to the eye. Leaving the main road to the left,
and entering the grounds by the Lodge, a carriage drive of a mile or more
in length through the well-wooded park leads to the mansion, which is at
once elegant, picturesque, and “homely.” To it, however, we are only
able to devote very brief attention.</p>

<p>Clumber is of comparatively modern erection, having been first built
in 1770, and received since then many important additions. It has, therefore,
no history attached to it. The place was, till about that time, simply a wild
tract of forest land, which the then noble duke who planned and carried out
the works cleared and cultivated at an enormous outlay, forming the extensive
lake at an expense of some £7,000, and erecting the mansion at a
princely cost.</p>

<p>The main feature of the house is its west front, facing the lake: this we
have engraved. Its centre is a colonnade, and this gives access to the
entrance hall, the oldest portion of the house being a part of the shooting-box,
to which magnificent additions have been made. Between the
mansion and the lake are the Italian gardens, elegantly laid out in beds
of the richest flowers, and well diversified with vases and statuary; in the
centre is a fountain of large size (the bowl being nearly thirteen feet in
diameter), of white marble and of Italian workmanship.</p>

<p>The family of Pelham, which, with that of Clinton, is represented by the
Duke of Newcastle, is of considerable antiquity in the county of Hertford,
deriving the name from the manor or lordship of Pelham, in that county,
which, in the reign of Edward I., belonged to Walter de Pelham. He died
in 1292, leaving two sons&mdash;William, who died without issue, and Walter,
who was succeeded by his son, Thomas de Pelham. John de Pelham, the
grandson of this latter, “was a person of great fame in the reign of King
Edward III.; and in memory of his valiant acts, his figure, in armour, with
the arms of the family on his breast, was painted on glass in the Chapter-house
at Canterbury, being (’tis probable) a benefactor to the cathedral, or
was buried there.” At the battle of Poictiers he shared the glory of taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1319" id="Page_1319">[1319]</a></span>
the French king prisoner with “Lord la Warr, and in memory of so signal
an action, and the king’s surrendering his sword to them, Sir Roger la
Warr, Lord la Warr, had the crampet or chape of his sword for a badge of
that honour, and John de Pelham (afterwards knighted) had the buckle of
a belt as a mark of the same honour, which was sometimes used by his
descendants as a seal manual, and at others the said buckle on each side a
cage, being an emblem of the captivity of the said King of France, and was
therefore borne as a crest, as in those times was customary.” The
“Pelham buckle” is still the badge of the family. Sir John married Joan,
daughter of Vincent Herbert, or Finch, ancestor of the Earls of Winchelsea
and Nottingham, and was succeeded by his son, John de Pelham, who was
no less famous than his father for many great achievements and honourable
exploits. He was Constable of Pevensey Castle, Treasurer to the King,
Ambassador to the French King, and held many other important offices,
and was knighted. Dying in 1428, Sir John was succeeded by his son, Sir
John de Pelham, who also held many offices. He married twice: first,
Joan, co-heiress of Sir John d’Escures; and, secondly, Joan de Courcy, by
whom he had issue, with others, his son and successor, Sir John de Pelham,
who married Alice, daughter of Sir Thomas Lewknor, but died without
male issue, when the estates passed to his brother, William de Pelham,
who also died without issue, and was succeeded by his brother Thomas.</p>

<p>Thomas Pelham was consecutively succeeded by his sons, John and Sir
William, the latter of whom married, first, Mary, daughter of Sir Richard
Carew; and, secondly, Mary, daughter of William, Lord Sands of the Vine,
Lord Chamberlain to Henry VIII. By his first wife he had issue, with
others, a son Nicholas, of whom hereafter; and by his second, with others,
a son William, who became famous: from him descended the Pelhams of
Brocklesby. Sir Nicholas Pelham married Anne Sackville, and, at his
death in 1559, was succeeded by his son, Sir John Pelham, who married
Judith, daughter of Oliver, Lord St. John of Bletsoe, by whom he had a
son, Oliver, who died young four years after his father. He was succeeded
by Thomas, brother to Sir John, who was created a baronet in 1611. He
married Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Walsingham, and was succeeded by
his son, Sir Thomas Pelham, as second baronet, who married three times,
and left issue by his first and third wives. The eldest of these was his
successor, Sir John Pelham, Bart., who married the Lady Lucy, daughter
of the Earl of Leicester, by whom he had a family of three sons and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1320" id="Page_1320">[1320]</a></span>
daughters. He died in 1702-3, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir
Thomas Pelham, Bart., who, in 1706, was raised to the peerage by the
title of Baron Pelham of Laughton, in Sussex.</p>

<p>Lord Pelham married, first, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Jones,
Attorney-General, and, secondly, the Lady Grace Holles, youngest daughter
of Gilbert, Earl of Clare, and sister of John Holles, fourth Earl of Clare,
created Duke of Newcastle (who had married the Lady Margaret Cavendish,
daughter and co-heiress of Henry Cavendish, second Duke of Newcastle),
by whom he had issue two sons&mdash;Thomas and Henry&mdash;and five daughters.
He died in 1711-12, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Thomas, as second
Baron Pelham.</p>

<p>This peer was born in 1693, and by the will of his uncle, John Holles,
Duke of Newcastle, “was made his heir, and authorised to bear the name
and arms of Holles.” Besides many other important offices, he was made
Steward, Keeper, and Warden of the Forest of Sherwood and the Park of
Folewood, in the county of Nottingham, and in 1714 was promoted to the
dignity of Earl of Clare and Viscount Haughton, with remainder, in default
of male issue, to his brother, the Hon. Henry Pelham and his heirs male.
In the following year he was created Marquis of Clare and Duke of Newcastle,
with the like remainder, and was made a K.G. He married, in
1717, Lady Harriet Godolphin, co-heiress of Lord Godolphin, and granddaughter
of John, Duke of Marlborough, but died without issue in 1768.
His brother, Henry Pelham, who had married Lady Catherine Manners,
daughter of the Duke of Rutland, having also died without surviving male
issue, the estates and the titles of Duke of Newcastle and Baron Pelham
passed to Henry Clinton, ninth Earl of Lincoln, who had married Catherine,
daughter of Henry Pelham, and whose mother was the Lady Lucy Pelham,
the Earl assuming the name of Pelham in addition to that of Clinton. His
grace had issue&mdash;Henry Pelham-Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, who died during
his father’s lifetime without male issue, and Lord Thomas Pelham-Clinton,
who succeeded to the titles and estates.</p>

<p>Thomas Pelham-Clinton, third Duke of Newcastle, was born in 1752,
and married the Lady Anna Maria Stanhope, daughter of the second Earl
of Harrington, and by her had issue two sons and two daughters. He died
in 1795, and was succeeded by his eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry Pelham Pelham-Clinton, fourth Duke of Newcastle and eleventh
Earl of Lincoln, who held many local appointments, and was a man of high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1321" id="Page_1321">[1321]</a></span>
attainments. He married, in 1807, Georgiana Elizabeth, daughter of
Edward Miller Mundy, Esq., of Shipley Hall, Derbyshire, and by her had
issue five daughters&mdash;viz. the Ladies Anna Maria, Georgiana, Charlotte,
Caroline Augusta, and Henrietta&mdash;and six sons, viz. Henry Pelham, Earl
of Lincoln (who succeeded him), and Lords Charles Pelham, Thomas
Charles Pelham, William, Edward, and Robert Renebald. His grace died
in 1864, and was succeeded by his eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, as fifth duke. This nobleman was born
in 1811, and, as Earl of Lincoln, represented South Nottinghamshire and
the Falkirk burghs in Parliament. His grace, who was a man of the
highest integrity, was the confidential friend of H.R.H. the Prince of
Wales (who visited Clumber in 1861), was successively Lord Warden of the
Stannaries, Chief Secretary for Ireland, Secretary of State for the Colonies,
and Secretary of State for War. He married, in 1832, the Lady Susan
Harriet Catherine, daughter of the tenth Duke of Hamilton (which marriage
was dissolved in 1850, the Duchess in 1860 being married to M.
Opdebeck, of Brussels), and by her had issue three sons and one daughter.
These were&mdash;the present duke (of whom directly); Lord Edward William
Pelham-Clinton, born in 1836, married to Matilda, daughter of Sir W. E.
Cradock-Hartopp, Bart.; Lord Arthur Pelham-Clinton, M.P., born 1840,
who died in 1870; Lord Albert Sydney Pelham-Clinton, born in 1845, and
married to Frances Evelyn, widow of Captain E. Stotherd; and the late
Lady Susan Charlotte Catherine Pelham-Clinton, born in 1839, married to
Lord Adolphus Frederick Charles William Vane-Tempest, son of the third
Marquis of Londonderry.</p>

<p>The present head of this illustrious house, Henry Pelham Alexander
Pelham-Clinton, sixth Duke of Newcastle, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, and
thirteenth Earl of Lincoln, was born in 1834, and educated at Eton and
at Christ Church, Oxford. He sat, when Earl of Lincoln, for Newark, and
was attached to Lord Grenville’s mission to Russia in 1856. In 1861 his
grace married Henrietta Adela, only daughter of the late Henry Thomas
Hope, Esq., of Deepdene, Surrey, and Castle Blaney, county Monaghan (by
his wife, the Hon. Gertrude Elphinstone, daughter of the fourteenth Lord
Elphinstone), by whom he has issue living&mdash;Henry Pelham Archibald
Douglas, Earl of Lincoln, born in 1864; Lord Henry Francis Hope Pelham-Clinton,
born in 1866; the Lady Beatrice Adeline Pelham-Clinton, born in
1862; and the Lady Emily Augusta Mary Pelham-Clinton, born in 1863.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1322" id="Page_1322">[1322]</a></span></p>

<p>The arms of the Duke of Newcastle are&mdash;quarterly, first and fourth
<i>argent</i>, six cross-crosslets, three, two, and one, <i>sable</i>, on a chief, <i>azure</i>, two
mullets pierced, <i>or</i>, for Clinton; second and third, the two coats of Pelham,
quarterly, viz. first and fourth <i>azure</i>, three pelicans vulning themselves,
<i>argent</i>, second and third <i>gules</i>, two pieces of belts with buckles erect, in pale,
the buckles upwards, <i>argent</i> (being an augmentation in commemoration of
the part Sir William Pelham took in the capture of the French king at the
battle of Poictiers). Crests&mdash;first, out of a ducal coronet, <i>gules</i>, a plume of
five ostrich feathers, <i>argent</i>, banded <i>azure</i>, for Clinton; second, a peacock
in pride, <i>proper</i>, for Pelham. Supporters&mdash;two greyhounds, <i>argent</i>, plain
collared and lined, <i>gules</i>.</p>

<p>His grace is patron of ten livings&mdash;viz. Worksop, Shireoaks, Cromwell,
Elksley, Bothansall, Brinsley, Markham Clinton, East Markham, Kirton,
and Mapplebeck.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to describe minutely any of the apartments
of this “Home” of the Newcastles&mdash;Clumber. The house has been said,
very absurdly, to be “a second Chatsworth,” and that “it embraces
magnificence and comfort more than any other nobleman’s mansion in
England;” but it is not so. It is a noble mansion, some of its rooms
being characterized by great elegance and beauty, and by pureness of taste,
while others are of a more mediocre character. To some of the apartments
and their contents we proceed to direct attention.</p>

<p>The Entrance Hall, with an arcade supporting its ceiling, contains,
among other works of Art, a semi-colossal statue of Napoleon, which has
usually been ascribed to Canova, but has also, with reason, been stated to
be Franzoni’s reproduction of Chaudet’s great work: it was purchased at
Carrara, in 1823, by the then Duke of Newcastle. In the same hall,
besides others, are Bailey’s statue of the poet Thomson, a fine figure of
Paris, and busts of the Duke of Newcastle by Nollekens, Sir Robert Peel,
Cromwell, Verschaffer’s Triton and Dolphins, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Library, perhaps the finest apartment in the mansion, is a noble
room, of large size and lofty proportions, and fitted in a style of great
magnificence. The geometric ceiling is richly decorated, and around the
upper part of the room is a light and elegant gallery. Besides the choice
collections of rare old books, and those of more modern times, which are
arranged round the walls of the Library and the Reading-room (to which
access is gained by a lofty arch springing from pilasters of the composite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1323" id="Page_1323">[1323]</a></span>
order), they contain Sir R. Westmacott’s noble statue of Euphrosyne, Bailey’s
Thetis and Achilles, many good bronzes, and an assemblage of objects of
<i>virtu</i>. From the windows of these rooms fine views of the Grounds, the
Park, and the Lake are obtained.</p>

<p>The State Dining-room, an elegant apartment, has a richly decorated
geometric ceiling and a recessed buffet, the recess being formed by well-proportioned
Corinthian columns. The rich cornice, the gilt festoons
that adorn the walls, the mirrors between the windows, the antique
Venetian crystal-glass chandelier and side lights, and the silver-gilt service
on the buffets give a sumptuous air to the room, while the four magnificent
Snyders, and the other fine old paintings which adorn the walls, add
materially to its beauty.</p>

<p>The principal Drawing-room, hung with satin damask, and the furniture
of the most costly and elegant character, is a noble apartment, and contains,
besides Lawrence’s portraits of the fourth Duke of Newcastle and his
duchess, good examples of the Carracci, Vandyke, Castiglione, and others;
while in the Crimson Drawing-room are pictures by Rembrandt, Rubens,
Poussin, Guido Reni, and Canaletti.</p>

<p>The Grand Staircase, with its iron-work railing, originally described as
being “curiously wrought and gilt in the shape of crowns, with tassels
hanging down between them from cords twisted in knots and festoons,” has
stained-glass windows, and is enriched with a number of portraits and other
paintings. Among the portraits are Pitt, Thomson, Scott, Southey, Campbell,
King George II., Queen Caroline, Prince Rupert, Dante, Cowley,
and Hatton; and among the other paintings are examples of Snyders,
Westall, Van Oss, Andrea Sacchi, Lely, Shackleton, Diepenbeck, and
others.</p>

<p>The other apartments&mdash;the Breakfast-room, Billiard-room, Smoking-rooms,
Ante-rooms, and what not&mdash;as well as the bed-room suites, are mostly
elegant in their fittings, convenient in their appointments, and replete with
choice works of Art. We, however, pass them over, simply remarking that
among these Art treasures are striking examples of Gainsborough (the
“Beggar Boys”), Gerard Douw, Poussin, Borgognone, Neefs, Van der
Meulin, Carlo Dolce (the “Marriage of St. Catherine”), Vandyke, Titian,
Rembrandt, Breughel, Ruysdael, Teniers, Lely, Rubens (his wife), Andrea
del Sarto, Salvator Rosa, Claude Lorraine, Wouvermans, Hogarth (portraits
of himself and wife), Reynolds, Jansen, Holbein, Van Loo, Creswick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1324" id="Page_1324">[1324]</a></span>
Dahl, Domenichino, Dobson, Rigaud, Cranach, Kneller, and others. Many
of these are gems of Art of a high order of excellence.</p>

<p>At Clumber, too, are preserved four highly interesting Roman sepulchral
altars, which were thus described by the Rev. Archdeacon Trollope, with
the accompanying engravings:<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>&mdash;“No. 1 bears the following inscription on
the two small front panels: <span class="smcap lowercase">M. CAEDICI . FAVSTI . NEGOTIATOR . DE . SACRA .
VIA . CAEDICIA . SYNTYCHE . CONLIBERTA</span>&mdash;one that is interesting as bearing
reference to a tradesman of the celebrated <i>Via Sacra</i> at Rome. The birds
pecking at a basket of fruit between them would seem to claim a Christian
origin for this work of Art, had not the ox’s head and pendent sacrificial
garland in addition to the heads at the angles&mdash;apparently of Jupiter
Ammon&mdash;pointed to heathenism; the garland intermixed with birds, below
the inscription, is both rich and graceful. No. 2 rises from an enriched
plinth, bearing, first, on the pediment of its coped lid, the inscription:
<span class="smcap lowercase">D. M. M. IVNI . IVNIANI</span>, and, on a panel below, <span class="smcap lowercase">D. M. ANTONIA . TARENTINA .
CONIVGI . BENE . MERENTI . FECIT</span>, forming a short but affectionate epitaph
from a wife to a husband, worthy in these respects of modern imitation.
Four masks are placed at the corners of the lid, and on another part of the
lid appears a boar, for which animal Tarentum was famous. The figures
sculptured in front perhaps represent one of the funereal games. No. 3 is
a well-designed coped urn, both its form and details having received much
careful attention. Within a long panel, surrounded by an enriched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1325" id="Page_1325">[1325]</a></span>
moulding, is the inscription, <span class="smcap lowercase">TI . IVLIO . FELICI . MANNEIA . TREPTEETTI .
IVLIVS . PHILONICVS . HEREDES . FECERVNT</span>. No. 4 is a longer and lower
urn than the others, having two small panels prepared for inscriptions,
which never appear to have been filled up. Small fanciful pillars, or
candelabra, surmounted by birds, form the angles of the urn, from which
depend rich garlands of fruit.”</p>

</div>

<p>Adjoining the mansion, but apart from it, is the unfinished Chapel&mdash;a
design of much elegance, the work of Messrs. Hine, of Nottingham&mdash;which
forms a prominent and pleasing feature from the grounds and lake. It
consists of a nave and chancel, with chancel-screen and semicircular apse,
and has on its north side an organ loft, and on its south a sacristy; and it
has an elegant bell-turret and spire.</p>

<p>The Pleasure-grounds of Clumber are very extensive, and laid out with
much taste. The terrace, which runs along by the lake, is of vast length,
and is beautifully diversified with statuary, vases, lovely beds of flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1326" id="Page_1326">[1326]</a></span>
and shrubs and trees; from it flights of steps lead down to the lake, and
other steps give access to the Italian Gardens. A great feature of the
grounds is the enormous size and singular growth of the cedars: some of
these are said to be unsurpassed in England both for their girth and for
their magnificently picturesque and venerable appearance. Some of the
conifers, too, are of extraordinary size and beauty.</p>

<p>The Kitchen Gardens are extensive and well arranged, and the Park
well stocked.</p>

<p>The Lake is one of the glories of Clumber. It is a splendid sheet of
water, covering some eighty or ninety acres of ground, and beautifully
diversified on its banks with woods of tall forest trees and rich verdant
glades. On the bosom of the Lake rest two ships&mdash;one a fine three-master,
forming a striking feature in the view.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Clumber is rich in places of interest and in lovely
localities;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and its near proximity to Sherwood Forest&mdash;indeed, it is itself a
part of that forest reclaimed&mdash;to Thoresby, to Hardwick Wood, to Welbeck,
to Osberton, to Worksop and its manor, to Bilhagh, to Rufford, and to a
score of other inviting localities, renders it one of the pleasantest, most
desirable, and most enjoyable of “Homes.”</p>

<p class="dc16 p3">WELBECK, which we have chosen as the subject of our present
chapter, has a history, a character, an appearance, and an
interest that are entirely and peculiarly its own. In its external
character it differs very materially in many points from any other
mansion yet built; while its internal arrangements and means of
access from one part to another are so original, and so entirely
distinct from what has anywhere else been adopted, as at once to prove its
noble owner, his Grace the Duke of Portland, by whom it has been planned,
and is being carried out, to be a man of enlarged mind, of princely ideas,
of noble conceptions, of high engineering skill, and of great constructive
ability. It is a place, as we have said, entirely to itself, by itself, and of
itself; it is a place many of whose features, both in general plan and in
minute detail, might with advantage be taken as examples for others to
follow. Vying in extent with some of the largest mansions of the kingdom,
Welbeck cannot, like them, be all seen on the surface, for many of its
noblest and grandest features, and much of the finest and most complicated
parts of its constructive skill, are hidden away from the general observer,
and only flash upon him as brilliant creations of genius when he is permitted
to approach them by descending into the “bowels of the earth;”
then, and then only, does the magnificence of the design of the noble owner
become apparent, and then only does the vastness of the work become
manifest. But of these features we shall speak presently; first let us say a
few words upon its past history and the changes it has undergone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1328" id="Page_1328">[1328]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <p class="pc"><i>Welbeck, West Front and Oxford Wing.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Welbeck, with its broad domain, is situated in Nottinghamshire, about
four miles from Worksop, and close to the borders of the county of Derby.
Its parks are one grand succession of fine old forest trees, and its herds of
deer&mdash;for it has its herd of white deer, its herd of fallow deer, and its
separate herds of red and other deer&mdash;are of great extent and of fine and
noble quality. Before the Conquest Welbeck was held by the Saxon
Sweyn, but afterwards it passed to the Flemangs as part of the manor of
Cuckney. By Thomas de Cuckney (grandson of Joceus de Flemang) the
Abbey was founded, and here, in the reign of Henry II., he planted a
settlement of Præemonstratensian or White Canons from Newhouse, in
Lincolnshire, the first house in which they were established in England.
The Abbey was dedicated to St. James, and endowed with grants of lands.
These were from time to time considerably augmented, and “in 1329 the
Bishop of Ely bought the whole of the manor of Cuckney, and settled it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1329" id="Page_1329">[1329]</a></span>
upon the Abbey on condition of their finding eight canons who should enjoy
the good things and pray for Edward the Third and his queen, their
children and ancestors, &amp;c.; also for the bishop’s father and mother,
brother, &amp;c.; ‘but especially for the health of the said lord bishop whilst
he lived, and after his death for his soul, and for all theirs that had
faithfully served him or done him any good;’ to which was added this
extraordinary injunction, that they should observe his anniversary, and on
their days of commemorating the dead ‘should absolve his soul by name;’
a process whose frequent repetition might naturally be considered as needless,
unless the pious bishop supposed that he might perhaps commit a few
additional sins whilst in purgatory.”</p>

<p>In 1512, it is stated, the Abbey at Welbeck was made the head of the
order. At the dissolution it was granted to Richard Whalley, and later on,
after other changes, passed to Sir Charles Cavendish, of whom we shall
speak presently. By him the Abbey was converted into a noble mansion,
but little of the original religious house being left standing, and these parts
only used as cellars, or here and there a wall, for the new building. The
present mansion is said to have been commenced in 1604, and was afterwards
much altered and enlarged, the riding-house being built in 1623,
and the stables two years afterwards, from the designs of John Smithson.
By the late Duke of Portland many alterations in the mansion were
effected, and the grounds were also much improved.</p>

<p>We have just alluded to Sir Charles Cavendish, and this leads us on to
the consideration of the descent of the estates from his time down to that of
the present noble owner, and enables us to give, as is our wont, a genealogical
account of the great and important families to whom Welbeck has
belonged. The family of Cavendish, as already more fully detailed in our
account of Chatsworth, traces back to the Conquest, when Robert de Gernon,
who came over with the Conqueror, so distinguished himself in arms that
he was rewarded with grants of land in Hertfordshire, Gloucestershire, &amp;c.
His descendants held considerable lands in Derbyshire, and Sir William
Gernon obtained a grant of a fair at Bakewell, in that county. He had two
sons&mdash;Sir Ralph de Gernon, Lord of Bakewell, and Geoffrey de Gernon, of
Moor Hall, near Bakewell. From the second of these, Geoffrey de Gernon,
the Cavendishes descend. His son, Roger de Gernon (who died in 1334),
married the heiress of John Potton, or Potkins, lord of the manor of
Cavendish, in Suffolk, and by her had issue four sons, who all assumed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1330" id="Page_1330">[1330]</a></span>
name of Cavendish from their mother’s manor. These were&mdash;Sir John
Cavendish, Chief Justice of the King’s Bench in the time of Edward III., and
Chancellor of Cambridge, 4th of Richard II., who was beheaded by the
insurgents of Suffolk in that reign; Roger Cavendish, from whom descended
the celebrated navigator, Sir Thomas Cavendish; Stephen Cavendish, Lord
Mayor, member of Parliament, and Sheriff of London; and Richard
Cavendish. Sir John married Alice, daughter of Sir John Odyngseles,
Chief Justice of the King’s Bench, who brought to her husband the manor
of Cavendish-Overhall, and by her, who died before him, had issue two sons&mdash;Andrew
and John&mdash;and a daughter, Alice, married to William Nell. Sir
Andrew Cavendish, the eldest son, was Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk. By
his wife, Rose, he left issue one son, William, from whom the estate
passed to his cousin. Sir Andrew was succeeded by his brother, Sir John
Cavendish, Esquire of the Body to Richard II. and Henry V., who, for his
gallant conduct in killing Wat Tyler, in his conflict with Sir William
Walworth, was knighted by Richard II. in Smithfield, and an annuity of
£40 per annum granted to him and his sons for ever. He was also made
Broiderer of the Wardrobe to the King. He married Joan, daughter of Sir
William Clopton, of Clopton, in Suffolk, and by her had issue three sons&mdash;William,
his successor; Robert, serjeant-at-law; and Walter. William
Cavendish, who was a citizen and mercer of London, and of Cavendish-Overhall,
married Joan Staventon, by whom he had two sons&mdash;Thomas and
William. This Thomas Cavendish, who was of Cavendish and Pollingford,
in Suffolk, married Katharine Scudamore, and left by her, as son and heir,
Sir Thomas Cavendish, who, having studied the law, was employed by
Thomas, Earl of Surrey, Treasurer of the King’s Exchequer. He was also
Clerk of the Pipe in the Exchequer to Henry VIII. He married twice,
and left, by his first wife, Alice, daughter and co-heiress of John Smith, of
Podbroke Hall, besides other issue, three sons&mdash;George Cavendish, Sir
William Cavendish, and Sir Thomas Cavendish.</p>

<p>George Cavendish, the eldest of these three sons, was of Glemsford and
Cavendish-Overhall, and is said to have been the author of “Cavendish’s
Life of Wolsey,” although the authorship of that work has also been
attributed to his brother, Sir William Cavendish. He received a liberal
education, and was endowed by his father with considerable landed property
in Suffolk. His character and learning seem to have recommended him to
the special notice of Cardinal Wolsey, who “took him to be about his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1331" id="Page_1331">[1331]</a></span>
person, as gentleman usher of his chamber, and placed a special confidence
in him.” George Cavendish was succeeded by his son William, and
ultimately the manor of Cavendish-Overhall passed to William Downes.
Sir Thomas Cavendish was one of the knights of St. John of Jerusalem, and
died unmarried.</p>

<p>Sir William Cavendish, the second son of the first Sir Thomas, became
the founder of the ducal House of Devonshire and of several other noble
families. He was married three times: first, to a daughter of Edward Bostock,
of Whatcross, in Cheshire; secondly, to a daughter of Sir Thomas Conyngsby,
and widow of William Paris; and, thirdly, to Elizabeth,
daughter of John Hardwick, of Hardwick, and widow
of Robert Barley, of Barley, all in the county of Derby.
He was “a man of learning and business,” and was
much employed in important affairs by his sovereigns,
filling the posts of Treasurer of the Chamber and Privy
Councillor to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary.
At the suppression of the religious houses under
Henry VIII. he was “appointed one of the commissioners
for visiting them, and afterwards was made
one of the auditors of the Court of Augmentation,”
which was instituted for the purpose of augmenting the
revenues by the suppression of the monasteries. For his services he received
three valuable manors in Hertfordshire, which, later on, he exchanged for
lands in Derbyshire and other counties. He was also knighted by
Henry VIII. By his first wife he had issue one son and two daughters who
died young, and two other daughters, one of whom, Catherine, married Sir
Thomas Brooke, son of Lord Cobham, and the other, Anne, married Sir Henry
Baynton. By his second wife he had three daughters, who all died young,
and she herself died in child-birth. By his third marriage with “Bess of
Hardwick” he had a numerous family&mdash;viz. Henry Cavendish, of Tutbury,
member of Parliament for Derbyshire, who married Grace, daughter of
George, Earl of Shrewsbury, but died without lawful issue; Sir William
Cavendish, created Earl of Devonshire, and direct ancestor of the Dukes of
Devonshire; Sir Charles Cavendish, of Bolsover Castle and of Welbeck
Abbey, ancestor of the Dukes of Newcastle, Portland, &amp;c. (of whom presently);
Frances, married to Sir Henry Pierrepoint, ancestor to the Dukes
of Kingston; Elizabeth, married to Charles Stuart, Duke of Lennox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1332" id="Page_1332">[1332]</a></span>
(younger brother of Lord Darnley, the husband of Mary, Queen of Scots,
and father of King James I.), the issue of which marriage was the sadly
unfortunate Lady Arabella Stuart; and Mary, married to Gilbert, Earl of
Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>Of the Countess of Shrewsbury, “Bess of Hardwick,” mother of the
founder of this house, it will now be well to say a few words. The family
to which she belonged, and of which she eventually became heiress, that of
Hardwick, of Hardwick was one of considerable antiquity in the county of
Derby. One of the family, William Hardwick, married
the heiress of Goushill, of Barlborough, and by her
had two sons, the eldest of whom, Roger Hardwick,
married the daughter of Robert Barley, of Barley, and
had issue by her, John, who married Elizabeth,
daughter of Henry Bakewell, of Bakewell. Their
son, John Hardwick, married Elizabeth Pinchbeck, of
Pinchbeck, and was succeeded by his son, John Hardwick,
who espoused Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas
Leake, of Hasland, of the same family as the Leakes,
Earls of Scarsdale. By this marriage John Hardwick,
who died in 1527, had issue one son&mdash;John Hardwick&mdash;and four
daughters&mdash;Mary, Elizabeth, Alice, and Jane. The son, John, who was
only three years old at his father’s death, married Elizabeth, daughter of
Philip Draycott, of Paynsley, but died without issue, leaving his four
sisters his co-heiresses. Of these Elizabeth, afterwards Countess of
Shrewsbury, inherited Hardwick and other estates. When very young&mdash;indeed,
it is said when scarcely fourteen years of age&mdash;she married Robert
Barley, of Barley (son of Arthur Barley, of Barley-by-Dronfield, in Derbyshire,
by his wife, Elizabeth Chaworth), who died a few months after
marriage, leaving his possessions to her and her heirs. By this short-lived
marriage she had no issue, and, after remaining a widow for some twelve
years or so, she married, as his third wife, Sir William Cavendish, by whom
she had a numerous issue, as will be presently shown. To Sir William
Cavendish this remarkable lady brought not only Hardwick and the other
possessions of her own family, but also those of the Barleys, which she had
acquired by her first marriage. Sir William died in 1557, and a few years
later his widow married, as her third husband, Sir William St. Loe, or
Santloe, Captain of the Guard to Queen Elizabeth, who settled the whole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1333" id="Page_1333">[1333]</a></span>
his estates upon her and her heirs, and thus greatly added to her already
immense possessions. By this marriage there was no issue, and, on the
death of Sir William St. Loe, she was a third time left a widow. Soon
afterwards she married, as his second wife (he being, of course, her fourth
husband), George, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, stipulating, however, that the
Earl’s eldest daughter, the Lady Grace Talbot, should marry her eldest son,
Sir Henry Cavendish, and that his second son, Gilbert Talbot (eventually
Earl of Shrewsbury), should marry her youngest daughter, Mary Cavendish.
These family nuptials were solemnised at Sheffield on the 9th of February,
1567-8, the younger of the two couples being at the time only about fifteen
and twelve years of age respectively.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Autograph of the Countess of Shrewsbury.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The events of the Countess of Shrewsbury’s life are so thoroughly mixed
up with those of the stirring times of the kingdom at large, more especially
during the period when the truly unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots, was in
the custody of the Earl and his countess, that it is unnecessary here to enter
into them. By the Earl of Shrewsbury the Countess had no issue, and
he dying in 1590, she, “Bess of Hardwick,” became, for the fourth time, a
widow. “A change of conditions,” says Bishop Kennet, “that perhaps
never fell to the lot of one woman, to be four times a creditable and happy
wife; to rise by every husband into greater wealth and higher honours; to
have a numerous issue by one husband only; to have all those children
live, and all by her advice be creditably disposed of in her lifetime; and,
after all, to live seventeen years a widow in absolute power and plenty.”
The Countess, as we have before written, “besides being one of the most
beautiful, accomplished, and captivating women of her day, was, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1334" id="Page_1334">[1334]</a></span>
exception, the most energetic, business-like, and able of her sex. In
architecture her conceptions were grand, while in all matters pertaining to
the arts, and to the comforts and elegancies of life, she was unsurpassed.
To the old hall of her fathers, where she was born and resided, she made
vast additions, and she entirely planned and built three of the most
gorgeous edifices of the time&mdash;Hardwick Hall, Chatsworth, and Oldcotes&mdash;the
first two of which were transmitted entire to the first Duke of
Devonshire. The latter part of her long and busy life she occupied almost
entirely in building, and it is marvellous what an amount of real work&mdash;hard
figures and dry details&mdash;she got through; for it is a fact, abundantly
evidenced by the original accounts remaining to this day, that not a penny was
expended on her buildings, and not a detail added or taken away, without
her special attention and personal supervision. Building was a passion with
her, and she indulged it wisely and well, sparing neither time, nor trouble,
nor outlay to secure everything being done in the most admirable manner.
It is said, and it is so recorded by Walpole, that the Countess had once
been told by a gipsy fortune-teller that she would never die so long as she
continued building, and she so implicitly believed this that she never ceased
planning and contriving and adding to her erections; and it is said that at
last she died in a hard frost, which totally prevented the workmen from
continuing their labours, and so caused an unavoidable suspension of her
works. Surely the fortune-teller here was a “wise woman” in more senses
than one, for it was wise and cunning in her to instil such a belief into the
Countess’s mind, and thus insure a continuance of the works by which so
many workmen and their families gained a livelihood, and by which later
generations would also benefit. Besides Chatsworth, Hardwick, Oldcotes,
and other places, the Countess founded and built the Devonshire Almshouses
at Derby, and did many other good and noble works. She died, full of
years and full of honours and riches, on the 23rd of February, 1607, and
was buried in All Saints’ Church, Derby, under a stately tomb which she
had erected during her lifetime, and on which a long Latin inscription is to
be seen.”</p>

<p>By her second husband, Sir William Cavendish, she alone had issue.
These were, as already detailed, Sir Henry Cavendish, of Tutbury, who
married the Lady Grace Talbot; Sir William Cavendish, created Earl of
Devonshire, from whom the Dukes of Devonshire and other lines of peers
are lineally descended; Sir Charles Cavendish, the founder of the noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1335" id="Page_1335">[1335]</a></span>
House of Newcastle; Frances, married to Sir Henry Pierrepoint, ancestor
of the Dukes of Kingston; Elizabeth, married to Charles Stuart, Duke of
Lennox, and mother of Lady Arabella Stuart; and Mary, married to Gilbert,
Earl of Shrewsbury. It is with the third of these, Sir Charles Cavendish,
that we have now to do.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Cavendish married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of
Cuthbert, Lord Ogle, and Baroness Ogle in her own right. He left issue
by his first wife, Margaret Kitson, three sons&mdash;Charles, who died an infant;
William, created Duke of Newcastle; and Sir Charles, of Bolsover. Dying
in 1617, the estates passed to the eldest surviving son, William Cavendish,
who became one of the greatest men of the age.</p>

<p>Sir William was successively created Baron Cavendish, of Bolsover, in
the county of Derby, Baron Ogle, Viscount Mansfield, Earl of Newcastle,
Earl of Ogle, Marquis of Newcastle, and Duke of Newcastle, was a Knight
of the Garter, and held many very important appointments. He was a
staunch Royalist, and suffered many losses and privations through his
wise adherence to the royal cause. He fortified the town of Newcastle,
the Castle of Bolsover, and other places, and did good service in overcoming
the Parliamentarian forces at Gainsborough, Chesterfield, Bradford,
and many other places. His grace built the greater part of Welbeck,
including the famous riding-house, yet standing, and the stables. He was
the most accomplished horseman of the time, and his name will ever remain
known as the author of the finest, most learned, and most extensive work
on horsemanship ever written. The original MS. of this marvellous treatise
is carefully preserved at Welbeck Abbey, and copies of the work, especially
the first French edition, with all the original plates, are of great rarity.
He also wrote some volumes of poetry. The “Horsemanship” is particularly
interesting to an historian of Welbeck, from the many plates in
which views of the mansion as it then existed are given: to these we may
again refer.</p>

<p>The Duke was married twice. First, to Elizabeth, daughter and sole
heiress of William Bassett, of Blore and Langley, Derbyshire, and widow of
the Hon. Henry Howard, third son of the Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire;
and, secondly, to Margaret, daughter of Sir Charles Lucas, and maid of
honour to Queen Henrietta. By his first wife the Duke had issue ten
children, six sons and four daughters, of whom five died young.</p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Margaret (Lucas), Duchess of Newcastle.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The surviving sons were Charles, who died during his father’s lifetime without
issue, and Henry, who succeeded to the titles and estates; and the three
surviving daughters were&mdash;Mary, married to Charles Cheney, of Chesham-Boys;
Elizabeth, married to the Earl of Bridgewater; and Frances, married
to Lord Bolingbroke. By his second wife, Margaret Lucas, the Duke had
no issue; but to this lady, who was of rare accomplishments and virtues&mdash;“a
very learned lady and a philosopher”&mdash;the world is indebted for many
valuable writings. Foremost among these is the admirable and interesting
“Life” of her husband, the Duke of Newcastle, to which too much justice
for its truthfulness, its precision of details, and its purity of affection cannot
be done. It is a “book for all time,” and to it we refer our readers who
may desire to peruse a worthy memoir of a worthy man. The Duchess died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1337" id="Page_1337">[1337]</a></span>
in 1673, and the Duke three years afterwards: they are buried under a
magnificent monument in Westminster Abbey, where the following is one
of the inscriptions:&mdash;“Here lyes the Loyall Duke of Newcastle and his
Dutchess his second wife, by whom he had no issue: Her name was
Margarett Lucas, youngest sister to the Lord Lucas, of Colchester; a noble
familie, for all the brothers were valiant, and all the sisters virtuous. This
Dutchess was a wise, wittie, and learned lady, which her many books do
well testifie; she was a most virtuous and a loveing and carefull wife, and
was with her Lord all the time of his banishment and miseries, and when
he came home never parted from him in his solitary retirements.”</p>

<p>Henry, second Duke, Marquis, and Earl of Newcastle, Earl and Baron
of Ogle, Viscount Mansfield, Baron Cavendish of Bolsover, and Baron
Bothal and Hepple, and a Knight of the Garter, succeeded his father, the
first duke. He married Frances Pierrepoint, of Thoresby, granddaughter
of the Earl of Kingston, by whom he had issue three sons (only one of
whom lived) and five daughters. The son, Henry Cavendish, Viscount
Mansfield, married a daughter of Percy, Duke of Northumberland, whose
name he assumed, but died during his father’s lifetime without surviving
issue. The daughters were&mdash;Elizabeth, married, first, to the Earl of Albemarle,
and, secondly, to the Duke of Montague; Frances, married to the Earl
of Bredalbane; Catherine, married to the Earl of Thanet; Arabella, married
to the Earl of Sunderland; and Margaret, married to John Holles, Earl of
Clare, afterwards Duke of Newcastle. The second duke died in 1671, and
the titles, in default of male issue, then became extinct.</p>

<p>By the marriage of the Lady Margaret Cavendish
with John Holles, fourth Earl of Clare, Welbeck
and other estates of the Duke of Newcastle passed
into his hands. In 1694 the Earl of Clare was
created Duke of Newcastle. His grace died at Welbeck,
through a fall from his horse, in 1711, and the
title thus again became extinct. He left issue an
only daughter, the Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles,
who married Edward Harley, second Earl of Oxford
and Mortimer, and thus conveyed the Welbeck and
Bolsover estates to that nobleman. The issue of this
marriage was an only daughter and heiress, the Lady Margaret
Cavendish Harley, who married William Bentinck, Duke of Portland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1338" id="Page_1338">[1338]</a></span>
and thus carried the Cavendish estates into that illustrious family. She
died in 1785.</p>

<p>William Bentinck, the first Earl of Portland, was a member of the
illustrious family of Bentinck, of Holland, and came over on his first visit
to England as page of honour to William, Prince of Orange (afterwards
King William III.), and was ambassador to this country to arrange the
marriage of that prince with our Princess Mary. On the accession of
William III. William Bentinck was created Baron of
Cirencester, Viscount Woodstock, and Earl of Portland,
and had many important appointments conferred upon
him. He married, first, Anne, daughter to Sir Edward
Villiers and sister of the Earl of Jersey, by whom he
had issue three sons (one of whom only survived and
succeeded him) and five daughters&mdash;viz. the Lady
Mary, married to the Earl of Essex, and afterwards to
the Hon. Conyers D’Arcy; the Lady Anne Margaretta,
married to M. Duyvenvorde, one of the principal nobles
of Holland; the Lady Frances Wilhelmina, married
to Lord Byron; the Lady Eleanora, who died unmarried;
and the Lady Isabella, married to the Duke of Kingston. His lordship
married, secondly, Jane, daughter of Sir John Temple, sister of Lord
Palmerston, and widow of John, Lord Berkeley of Stratton, and by her had
issue two sons and four daughters&mdash;viz. the Hon. William, who married the
Countess of Aldenburgh; the Hon. Charles John, who married the daughter
and heiress of the Earl of Cadogan; the Lady Sophia, married to Henry de
Grey, Duke of Kent; the Lady Elizabeth, married to the Bishop of Hereford,
brother to the second Duke of Bridgewater; the Lady Harriette,
married to Viscount Limerick; and the Lady Barbara, married to Godolphin,
Dean of St. Paul’s. The Earl died in 1735, and was succeeded by his son&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry, second Earl of Portland, who married the Lady Elizabeth Noel,
eldest daughter of the Earl of Gainsborough, by whom he received, with
other accessions, the lordship of Tichfield and its manor-house. His lordship,
who was advanced to the dignities of Marquis of Tichfield and Duke of
Portland, and held many important appointments, had issue three sons and
seven daughters, whereof two sons and three daughters survived him.
These were&mdash;William second Duke of Portland; Lord George Bentinck,
aide-de-camp to King George II.; the Lady Anne, married to Lieutenant-colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1339" id="Page_1339">[1339]</a></span>
Paul; the Lady Anne Isabella, married to Henry Monk, Esq.; and
the Lady Emilia Catherine, married to Jacob Arrant Van Wassenar, a noble
of Holland.</p>

<p>William, second Duke of Portland, was born in 1709, and married,
in 1734, the Lady Margaret Cavendish Harley, daughter and sole heiress
of the Earl of Oxford by his countess, daughter and sole heiress of
John Holles, Duke of Newcastle, who thus brought the estates of Welbeck,
&amp;c., to the Bentinck family. By this union his grace had issue three
sons and three daughters. These were&mdash;the Lady Elizabeth Cavendish
Bentinck, married to the Marquis of Thomond; Lady Henrietta Cavendish
Bentinck, married to the Earl of Stamford; William Henry Cavendish
Bentinck, Marquis of Tichfield (his successor), of whom presently; Lady
Margaret Cavendish Bentinck and Lady Frances Cavendish Bentinck, who
died young; and Lord Edward Charles Cavendish Bentinck, who married
Elizabeth Cumberland, and had numerous issue. The Duke died in 1762,
and was succeeded in his titles and estates by his eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>William Henry Cavendish Bentinck, as third Duke of Portland. This
nobleman, who was born in 1738, married, in 1766, the Lady Dorothy
Cavendish, only daughter of William, fourth Duke of Devonshire, and by
her had issue four sons and two daughters. These were&mdash;William Henry,
Marquis of Tichfield (his successor); General Lord William Henry
Cavendish Bentinck, Governor-General of India, who married a daughter of
the Earl of Gosford; Lady Charlotte Bentinck, married to Charles Greville,
Esq.; Lady Mary Bentinck; Lord William Charles Augustus Cavendish
Bentinck, who married, first, Miss G. A. F. Seymour, and, secondly, Anne,
daughter of the Marquis Wellesley, and divorced wife of Sir William Addy;
and Major-General Lord Frederick Cavendish Bentinck, who married the
Lady Mary Lowther, daughter of William, first Earl of Lonsdale of the
second creation, and by her, with other issue, became father of the present
Right Hon. George Augustus Frederick Cavendish Bentinck, M.P. for
Whitehaven, and a member of the Administration. The noble Duke died in
1809, and was succeeded by his eldest son&mdash;</p>

<p>William Henry, fourth Duke of Portland, who was born in 1768,
married in 1795 Henrietta, eldest daughter and co-heiress of General John
Scott, of Balconnie, county Fife, by whom he received a large accession of
property. His grace, by royal sign manual, assumed the additional
surname and arms of Scott, thus altering the family name to Scott-Bentinck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1340" id="Page_1340">[1340]</a></span>
By this marriage his grace had issue four sons and four daughters. These
were&mdash;William Henry Cavendish Scott-Bentinck, Marquis of Tichfield, who
died unmarried during his father’s lifetime; the Lady Henrietta; William
John, Marquis of Tichfield, who succeeded to the dukedom and estates;
Major Lord William George Frederick Cavendish Scott-Bentinck (known
as Lord George Bentinck), the eminent statesman and patriot, who died in
1848, to whom a fine Gothic memorial, somewhat after the manner of the
“Martyrs’ Memorial,” has been erected by public subscription at Mansfield,
from the design of Mr. T. C. Hine. It bears the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“To the memory of Lord George Frederick Cavendish Bentinck, second surviving son
of William Henry Cavendish-Scott, fourth Duke of Portland. He died the 21st day of September,
An. Dom. <span class="smcap lowercase">MDCCCXLVIII.</span>, in the forty-seventh year of his age. His ardent patriotism
and uncompromising honesty were only equalled by the persevering zeal and extraordinary
talents which called forth the grateful homage of those who, in erecting this memorial, pay
a heartfelt tribute to exertions which prematurely brought to the grave one who might long
have lived the pride of this his native county.”</p>

<p class="p1">Lord Henry William Cavendish Scott-Bentinck; the Lady Charlotte,
married to John Evelyn Denison, M.P.; the Lady Lucy, married to Lord
Howard de Walden; and the Lady Mary. His grace, who was a fellow
of the Royal Society, a trustee of the British Museum, and a man of high
scientific attainments, died in 1854, and was succeeded by his eldest
surviving son, the present noble head of this illustrious house.</p>

<p>William John Cavendish Scott-Bentinck, the present peer, fifth Duke of
Portland, Marquis of Tichfield, Earl of Portland, Viscount Woodstock,
Baron of Cirencester, and a co-heir to the barony of Ogle, was born on the
17th of September, 1800, and represented the borough of Lynn in Parliament.
In 1854 he succeeded his father in the titles and estates. The
Duke, who is unmarried, is a trustee of the British Museum, and a deputy-lieutenant
of the county of Nottingham. His grace, who is a man of the
most refined taste in all matters of Art, an accomplished scholar, and of
high attainments, is patron of thirteen livings&mdash;viz. Hendon, in Middlesex;
Hucknall-Torkard, Sutton-cum-Lound, Cotham, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Gotham,
and Sibthorpe, in Nottinghamshire; Bredon, in Worcestershire; Elsworth,
in Cambridgeshire; Whitwell, Elmton, and Bolsover, in Derbyshire; and

<p>The heir-presumptive to the titles and estates of the Duke of Portland is
his grace’s cousin, Major-general Arthur Cavendish Bentinck, youngest son
of the late Lord William Charles Augustus Cavendish Bentinck, brother of
the fourth duke. He was born in 1819, and married, first, in 1857, a
daughter of Sir Vincent Whitshed, Bart., who died in 1858 (by whom he
has a son, William John Arthur Charles James Cavendish Bentinck);
and, secondly, in 1862, Augusta Mary Elizabeth, daughter of the Hon. and
Very Rev. Henry Montague Browne, Dean of Lismore, by whom he has
also issue.</p>

<p>The earliest views of the mansion of Welbeck are those which occur
on the magnificent folio plates which accompany the Duke (at that time
Marquis) of Newcastle’s splendid and matchless work on “Horsemanship”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
in 1658. The plates are all splendidly engraved from Diepenbeck’s
drawings, and are among the most valuable illustrations of the period left to
us. One of these plates gives a general view of Welbeck (“La Maison de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1342" id="Page_1342">[1342]</a></span>
Welbeck appartenant à Monseigneur le Marquis de Newcastle, le quel est dans
la Province de Nottingham”), showing an extensive building four stories in
height, and partly enclosed with battlemented and other walls; the end
having three gables, with a central doorway, and the side of three distinct
lengths. The main building, that with the three gables, is four stories in
height, with mullioned and transomed windows, hipped windows in the
roof, and ornamental clustered chimney-shafts; the next portion three
stories high, and three windows in width, with rustic arched doorway,
windows of three semicircular-headed lights, and hipped windows in the
roof; and the third portion two stories in height, with a noble portico
approached by steps, and an outer gateway. Of this we give a carefully
reduced engraving.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>Part of Welbeck in 1658.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Another plate shows a different part of the mansion&mdash;a façade twelve
windows in length, and two stories in height; the windows transomed and
mullioned, and the whole surmounted by a bold balustrade. Above the
building in one part rises a square tower, and in another part a larger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1343" id="Page_1343">[1343]</a></span>
more ornamental tower, with a circular domed flag-turret and tall chimney-shafts.
It has simply the name “Welbeck.” A third plate, which
is extremely interesting, shows the exterior of the Riding-house (still
standing, but now converted to other uses), “Le Manege couert voute de
bois large de 40 pieds, longe de 120 pieds,” and “La boutique du
Marechall,” or the house of the officer in charge of the horses. Adjoining
the Riding-house is a noble sculptured Entrance Gateway. The fourth
engraving is the most elaborate, and certainly most interesting of the whole.
Over the main portion of the piles of buildings&mdash;that to the left, with a
central and two side doors, pilastered front, series of windows, domed
circular towers, and ornamental cornice&mdash;is the inscription, “L’Ecurie voutèe
de pierre, les piliers de pierre, la mangeoire de pierre à l’Italienne, et une
fontaine qui coule le long de la mangeoire, et se rend dans une voute au
dessous ou coule un petit ruisseau. Contre la teste de Chague Cheval il y a
une petite cheminèe pour l’haleine du Cheval, la quelle, s’ouvre se ferme,
selon a chaleur, ou froideur; Elle est parè de pierre de taille.” Over the
next portion, which is four stories high, pilastered, and seven windows in
length, is the name “Le Grenier de l’Ecurie.” Next comes the gateway
with the noble residence above it, and then the other buildings, bearing
above them the inscription, “Il y a d’autres Ecuries pour quatre-vint
chevaux.”</p>

<p>Another plate is a fine view of the Park at Welbeck, with a noble
avenue of trees in the centre, and abundance of deer, with hunting,
shooting, &amp;c. It is entitled “Le Parc de Welbeck appartenant à
Monseigneur le Marquis de Newcastle. Le Parc est dans la Province de
Nottingham.” A spirited equestrian figure of the Marquis is introduced in
the foreground.</p>

<p>The old Riding-house of the Duke of Newcastle still stands, as we
have said, but has been denuded of its internal arrangements, and converted
to a nobler purpose. The old “bell-boxes” for horses, and
the coach-houses, which formerly occupied a considerable part of the
interior (leaving the Riding-house “longe de 120 pieds,” as named on
the engraving), have been entirely taken away, and the whole building
is now one grand room, 177 feet in length by 40 feet in width, and
of great and exquisitely proportionable height. It would form one
of the finest banqueting halls in existence. It has a massive open-work
timber roof of high pitch, and of admirable design. The timber-work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1344" id="Page_1344">[1344]</a></span>
has, during the course of the decorations, been all painted white, the
roof itself being, with much taste, painted like a natural sky. The walls
are to some height wainscoted, and the folding doors at the ends of the
apartments, as well as the walls, are, with a marvellous effect, covered with
“looking-glass,” glass of the same character adorning the side-walls. By
this means a strikingly beautiful vista-like effect is produced, and the
whole room is rendered charmingly delightful. From the roof are suspended
a series of magnificent crystal-glass chandeliers, and side-lights of the same
kind are arranged along the walls. Externally the roof is covered with
copper, with admirable effect, while two clock-towers add much to the
general contour of the building. These towers contain clocks that are
marvels of constructive skill. They are thus spoken of by their maker,
Mr. Benson, in his “Time and Time Tellers:”&mdash;“In a set of clock-calendars
which I some time since provided for his Grace the Duke of
Portland, the clock showed the time on four dials five feet-nine inches in
diameter, chiming quarters, hours, &amp;c. (the well-known Cambridge chimes),
on bells of 12 cwt., repeating the hour after the first, second, and third
quarters. The two sides of an adjoining tower show a calendar which
indicates on special circles of a large dial, by means of three separate hands,
the month of the year, the day of the month, and the day of the week”
(needing no correction for the long and short months, nor even for the
month of February, with its occasional twenty-nine days). It has also a
wind dial, lettered with the four cardinal points and the twelve intermediates;
there is also an extra circle on the dial to mark the age of the moon and the
equation of time, so that each dial has four circles, besides the circle of the
moon, shifted simultaneously at twelve o’clock every night by the complicated
and wonderful mechanism of its interior.</p>

<p>Adjoining this noble room is a pile of building of exactly the same
size and character, devoted to kitchen and other domestic purposes, with
apartments over. The Kitchen is lofty, spacious, and well arranged, and
fitted with every possible convenience; the Servants’ Hall, an admirable
stone groined apartment, is near; and in the larders and other offices
fountains of clear water keep the air admirably cool. From the Kitchen an
underground railway with an hydraulic lift is constructed for conveying the
comestibles for serving in the dining-rooms.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to follow any regular order in briefly speaking
of the different rooms of this noble and unique mansion, but simply to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1345" id="Page_1345">[1345]</a></span>
allude to some of them, and then to speak of the Stables, Gardens, and
outside arrangements.</p>

<p>The Gothic Hall, a part of the old building, and altered and restored by the
Countess of Oxford in 1751, is a noble apartment in the centre of the west
front. The ceiling is of pendent fan-tracery of the most elaborate design,
and the whole of the decorations are of Gothic character, in keeping with the
ceiling. Over the fire-place rises an elaborate Gothic canopy, in three arches,
over the arms, with crest, supporters, &amp;c., of the Countess, and the letters</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">HC<br />
HOM<br />
1751.</p>

<p class="pn1">Over the doorways, beneath cusped Gothic arches, are also the arms of
Cavendish, with crescent for difference. This room, like every other
portion of the edifice, has been greatly improved by the taste of its noble
owner, and the mechanical skill of those employed by him: this is
evidenced in a remarkably ingenious and original contrivance for the
raising and lowering of the sashes of the windows, and in other ways. The
suite of rooms in this pile of building consists, among others, of the Dining-room,
admirably furnished, and hung with a fine collection of paintings;
the Small Drawing-room, an exquisite Doric apartment, in which, among
other Art treasures, are some of the finest existing samples of Snyders,
Rembrandt’s masterly portrait of himself, and the grand picture of
St. Cecilia, as well as some sumptuous inlaid ivory furniture; the Drawing-room,
filled with the choicest of pictures and the most superb of furniture;
the Saloon, &amp;c. From the windows of these apartments, looking to the
east, lovely views are obtained of the Lawns and Italian Gardens, planted
with shrubs and laid out in exquisite taste, with beds of gorgeously
coloured flowers; the Lake, with its broad expanse of water, some three
miles or more in length, and with a contour well broken by headings; the
extent of Deer Park beyond (the central object being the grand old lime-tree
shown in a portrait of the old duke); and the belt of gigantic forest trees
beyond. Altogether it is a charming scene, and one that shows well the
noble character of the scenery by which Welbeck is surrounded.</p>

<p>The “Oxford,” or “Lady Oxford’s” wing, to which another story, as
well as new towers and additional rooms in length, has been added by the
present duke, forms the south angle of the mansion. The apartments in
this wing are chastely beautiful, alike in their decorations, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1346" id="Page_1346">[1346]</a></span>
furnishing, and their appointments. The walls in most cases are in
distemper, of a warm roseate tint, and the carved panelling and other
decorations are of dead and burnished gold; while the furnishing, whether
with furniture of Louis XVI. style, or of gold and figured silk damask, or
what not, is, while of costly and sumptuous character, all arranged with the
most faultless purity of taste. The chimney-pieces, too, are in good taste;
they are mostly of white marble, artistically carved in medallion heads,
foliage, &amp;c., by workmen employed at Welbeck. One fine old chimney-piece
in the late duchess’s room is a grand example of Wedgwood’s sage-green
plaques inlaid in the marble. In this Oxford wing an hydraulic
lift, and every other possible appliance and convenience for the comfort of
the guests, have been added; indeed, in the whole mansion nothing is left
to be desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1347" id="Page_1347">[1347]</a></span></p>

<p>The Libraries are a suite of five superb apartments opening by wide
central doorways one into another, thus forming one great whole. It is
not usual with us to give dimensions of rooms, but, as this suite has some
striking peculiarities connected with it, we in this instance give them.
They are, in round numbers, 43 by 38 feet, 59 by 43 feet, 59 by 31 feet,
59 by 31 feet, and 58 by 31 feet. At the side of these runs, on one side, a
charming glass-roofed corridor of considerable width, and, on the other, an
arched covered corridor of great length. The ceilings of this suite of rooms
are geometrically panelled and highly enriched, and the whole is lighted
from the top.</p>

<p>Adjoining these is a spacious room 158 feet 10 inches in length by 63 feet
6 inches in width, the ceiling of which is one mass of chaste and beautiful
ornamentation. Its ceiling, flat and of geometrical design, is supported on
a series of eight wrought-iron girders, each weighing no less than twenty-two
tons, and the whole of the light is from the ceiling.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the construction of these rooms&mdash;the library suite and
the one last named, some stables, gardening and potting sheds, lodges, &amp;c.,
as well as others in progress&mdash;is that they are entirely underground, and are
approached from, and connected with, the rest of the mansion by underground
corridors and passages. The ground has been excavated to an
enormous depth, and at a princely cost, and these lofty rooms are erected below
the surface&mdash;a novelty in construction unattained elsewhere, and one that
possesses many decided advantages. The light is equal to any to be
attained in buildings on the surface, and it has an additional softness that
is peculiarly graceful; the drainage is thorough and complete, the
ventilation admirable, and the annoyances of wind and of draughts entirely
avoided. Verily the fairies, who in their day had their underground
palaces, and</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Held their courtly revels<br />
Down, down below,”</p>

<p class="pn1">must have been clever and far-seeing architects, for they thus kept themselves
clear from the elements, and could enjoy the summer sun in coolness,
and the winter’s wrath in warmth. This feature of Welbeck is, indeed, like
fairyland in its novelty and in its inward comforts, and its adoption was a
grand conception on the part of its noble owner. And now a few words on
other portions of the arrangements at Welbeck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1348" id="Page_1348">[1348]</a></span></p>

     <p class="pc"><i>Welbeck, the Riding School.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Riding School&mdash;the finest in existence&mdash;is a noble room, measuring
in its interior no less than 379 feet in length, by 106 feet in width, and above
50 feet in height. It is covered by a semicircular and highly ornate iron
and glass roof, rising from iron columns, which form the side of a charming
corridor running round it. This corridor has an open carved timber-work
roof, of elegant but massive design. The general idea of the design of this
roof has been taken from that of the old Riding-house, but altered in its
details, and rendered more elaborate and elegant: the cornice round the
main building is chastely decorated with wreaths of foliage, birds, and other
objects, arranged with great taste. The room is at night lighted by nearly
eight thousand gas jets, and has a strikingly beautiful effect. Near it are
the Hunting Stables, unequalled for amplitude of accommodation and for
excellence of arrangement, with their accompanying saddle-rooms, offices,
and grooms’ barracks. These stables form a quadrangle, the yard being
nearly 180 feet square, and contain some six-and-thirty spacious loose boxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1349" id="Page_1349">[1349]</a></span>
and a number of stalls, the planning and arrangement of the whole being
perfection itself. Not far from these are the coach-houses and coach-house
stabling, and the covered “gallop” and lunging-rooms. These form another
marked feature of Welbeck. The gallop is, in its entire interior length,
1,072 feet, and its general central width 33 feet; while the lunging-rooms
at either end are about 70 feet in width, and 191 and 293 feet in length
respectively. The whole of this immense space is covered with glass, and
laid down in tan, &amp;c.; it is believed to be the finest covered gallop in
existence. Besides this are outdoor tan gallops, roughing and brood
boxes, &amp;c. The Kennels are also very extensive.</p>

<p>The Cowyards, Cowhouses, Sheds, and Dairy are of great extent, and
are arranged with every modern appliance. The Dairy, in the centre of
which is a crystal sparkling fountain rising from a marble bowl, is unsurpassed
anywhere; the floor is of Minton’s encaustic tiles, and the fittings
and wall-tiles of chastely beautiful patterns. Near it are the steward’s and
other offices, the visitors’ stables, the telegraph office, and many other
buildings.</p>

<p>The Gardens of Welbeck are one of its great glories, so extensive, so
well arranged, so liberally provided, and so productive are they. Among
the special features&mdash;arrangements nowhere else on the same principle
adopted&mdash;are the peach wall, nearly one thousand feet in length, with
lean-to glass on Rendle’s patent, but so arranged, with a series of strawberry
beds on the other side of the path, that they can be lifted down and run, as on
a tramway, to cover the strawberries; thus each division of the lean-to
forms a frame to cover a strawberry bed of its exact size. The fruit walls
are built with recesses in their backs, in which braziers of fire can be placed,
so as to hasten and help the ripening of the fruit. The range of pine-houses
is about the same length, as are also the magnificent vineries. A
pretty and novel feature, too, is a fruit arcade. This arcade is nearly
one thousand feet in length, and is formed of a series of ornamental iron
arches, and over the whole of this are trained a number of apple-trees up one
side, and pear-trees up the other, and bearing profusely for the whole of this
immense length. Then there are the orchard-houses, in which hundreds of
standard peach and other trees grow in pots; the potting-houses, the pine-pits,
the conservatories, the forcing-houses, the giant mulberry-tree, and
a host of other gardening attractions.</p>

<p>Another important part of Welbeck is the series of Workshops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1350" id="Page_1350">[1350]</a></span>
Yards. Here are immense carpenters’ yards and workshops, fitted with
every possible kind of machinery and every mechanical appliance&mdash;fit
for the most extensive contractor; there the extensive stoneyards and
masons’ workshops; in another place the painters’ sheds and the forging-sheds;
in another the smiths’ and engineers’ shops; and in yet another the
powerful steam-engines for driving the various kinds of machinery. Here,
too, are extensive gas-works, consisting of no less than four huge gasometers;
the fire-engine house, fitted with engines in constant readiness and
with gear of every kind; the immensely ponderous traction engines, for
which his grace is so justly famous, and of which some six or seven are
constantly at work; and many other matters to which we need not allude.</p>

<p>The works now for many years carried on by the Duke of Portland have
been, and yet are, of the most stupendous character, and must have been
accomplished at a lavish and princely outlay. His grace has, however,
done all things “wisely and well,” and if his outlay <i>has</i> been princely, it
has been expended in a princely manner, and to the benefit of thousands of
his fellow-creatures. It is not for us, in a work like ours, to moralise, but it
strikes us that to enter upon and carry out large and important works in a
liberal, energetic, and spirited manner is a far better, far higher, and far
nobler way of filling a mission on earth than getting rid of capital in some
objectionable pursuits. The Duke of Portland is a great benefactor
to his race, and by finding employment, as he does, to some two thousand
persons or more, the good he does is incalculable.</p>

<p>The collection of pictures at Welbeck is very fine and very extensive,
and embraces many paintings, family portraits, and others of note and of
matchless value. Among these portraits are several of the celebrated Duke
of Newcastle, of his countesses, and of his horses, with views of Welbeck,
&amp;c.; a remarkably fine original portrait of the Countess of Shrewsbury,
“Bess of Hardwick,” bearing the inscription, “Eliz: Hardwick, Daughter
and Coheir of John Hardwick, of Hardwick in the County of Derby, Esq<sup>re.</sup>
Married to her second husband, Sir Wm. Cavendishe of Chatsworth, in the
same County. She settled her 3rd son Charles Cavendishe at Welbeck in
the County of Nottingham;” a remarkably fine original portrait of Mary,
Queen of Scots; an equally fine one of the Lady Arabella Stuart, by
Zucchero; portraits of most of the members of the Bentinck family and
their alliances, and of the Cavendish, Harley, and Holles families, besides
a large number of general subjects. Among them may be named as a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1351" id="Page_1351">[1351]</a></span>

Richardson, and another, by Rigaud; Charlotte Davis, Viscountess
Sundon; and Queen Elizabeth, by Lucas de Heere. These, however, are
not a tithe of the rare and excellent pictures contained in this splendid
collection, which our limits alone prevent us from enumerating. As an
assemblage of historical and family portraits, as well as of rare examples
of the best masters, the Welbeck collection takes high rank among the
choicest private galleries of the kingdom. The collection also includes
some good ivories and a large number of valuable miniatures. Among
the treasures here preserved, too, are the original MS. of the Duke
of Newcastle’s grand book on “Horsemanship,” already alluded to; a large
number of letters from royal, noble, and celebrated personages; several
patents of creation; a MS. account of the regalia, jewels, plate, &amp;c., of
Henry VIII., signed in several places by that monarch; some curious MS.
inventories; and many other matters of historical value.</p>

<p>Welbeck formerly had its share of royal visits, and of these some
curious accounts are given in the Duchess of Newcastle’s “Life” of her
husband. Thus&mdash;“When his Majesty (Charles I.) was going into Scotland
to be crowned, he took his way through Nottinghamshire; and lying
at Worksopp-Mannor, hardly two miles distant from <i>Welbeck</i>, where
my Lord then was, my Lord invited His Majesty thither to a Dinner, which
he was graciously pleased to accept of: this entertainment cost my Lord
between Four and Five thousand pounds; which His Majesty liked so well,
that a year after His Return out of <i>Scotland</i>, He was pleased to send my
Lord word, that Her Majesty the Queen was resolved to make a Progress
into the Northern parts, desiring him to prepare the like Entertainment for
Her, as he had formerly done for Him: Which my Lord did, and endeavour’d
for it with all possible Care and Industry, sparing nothing that
might add splendor to that Feast, which both Their Majesties were pleased
to honour with their Presence. <i>Ben Jonson</i> he employed in fitting such
Scenes and Speeches as he could best devise; and sent for all the Gentry of
the Country to come and wait on their Majesties; and in short, did all that
ever he could imagine, to render it Great and worthy Their Royal Acceptance.
This Entertainment he made at <i>Bolsover Castle</i>, in Derbyshire, some
five miles distant from <i>Welbeck</i>, and resigned <i>Welbeck</i> for Their Majesties
Lodging; it cost him in all between Fourteen and Fifteen thousand pounds.
Besides these two, there was another small Entertainment which my Lord
prepared for His late Majesty, in his own Park at <i>Welbeck</i>, when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1353" id="Page_1353">[1353]</a></span>
Majesty came down, with his two Nephews, the now Prince Elector
Palatine, and His Brother Prince <i>Rupert</i>, into the Forrest at <i>Sherwood</i>,
which cost him Fifteen hundred pounds. And this I mention not out of
a vain-glory, but to declare the great love and Duty my Lord had for His
Gracious King and Queen, and to correct the mistakes committed by some
Historians, who not being rightly informed of those Entertainments, make
the World believe Falsehood for Truth.” The first of Ben Jonson’s
masques here alluded to was entitled “Love’s Welcome. The King’s
entertainment at Welbeck, in Nottinghamshire, a house of the Right
Honourable William, Earl of Newcastle, Viscount Mansfield, Baron of
Bothal, Bolsover, &amp;c., at his going into Scotland, 1633.” It was one of the
best of Jonson’s masques, and the quintain was introduced and performed
by gentlemen of the county in the garb of rustics.</p>

<p>And now it only remains to say a word or two as to the surroundings of
Welbeck.</p>

<p>Welbeck Park, and the closely adjoining forest of Sherwood, have ever
been noted for their fine venerable trees&mdash;oaks that have stood for ages,
and bid fair to stand for ages yet to come. Many of the then fine old trees
were cut down “by the rebels” when Welbeck became for a time their
prey during the civil wars, but many still remained; and those then in their
prime have now become more venerable with age. A few of the more
noted may just be named. The “Duke’s Walking-stick,” so called from its
long straight stem, when described in 1813, and earlier by Major Rooke,
who considered it to be unmatched in the kingdom, measured 111 feet
6 inches in height, was estimated to weigh about 11 tons, and contained
about 440 solid cubic feet of timber. It no longer exists, but another tree,
a “young walking-stick,” we are informed, of nearly a century and a half’s
growth, is about 100 feet in height. The “Two Porters,” standing a little
distance apart, and named “the Porters” from a gate and fence having
formerly stood between them, are described as being about 98 and 88 feet
in height, and 38 and 34 feet in circumference; they stand nearly at the
north extremity of the park, not far from the south lodge of Worksop
Manor, and are marvels of growth and girth.</p>

<p>The “Seven Sisters,” situated about half a mile from the “Two Porters,”
is one of the most remarkable trees anywhere in existence. It consisted
originally of seven stems springing from one general root, and rising
perpendicularly to a great height&mdash;no less than 88 feet, the circumference of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1354" id="Page_1354">[1354]</a></span>
the common trunk close to the ground being over 30 feet. Some of the
sister stems have from time to time been blown down, but the tree is still a
noble and interesting one. Near it “a hollow tree, in circumference
20 feet 9 inches, supposed to be three hundred years old, was used as a
place of concealment from whence the keeper could aim at the deer.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-b354.jpg" width="300" height="405" id="b354"
         alt=""
         title="" />
     <p class="pc"><i>The Greendale Oak.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The “Ruysdael Oak,” so called because of being in form and condition
one of those peculiar trees which that painter delighted to introduce into his
pictures, stands on a commanding eminence in the park, not far from the
“Seven Sisters,” and forms a striking object from whichever side it is
seen. Venerable in its age, lovely in its decay, this “grand old oak”
stretches out its weird-like naked branches in every direction, and forms a
landmark that cannot be mistaken. From it, and, indeed, from many points
on this side of the park, some strikingly beautiful views of the mansion, the
lake, and the grounds are obtained.</p>

<p>In the part of the grounds known as “The Wilderness;” in the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1355" id="Page_1355">[1355]</a></span>
drives that intersect the forest; in the remains of “Merrie Sherwood,”
which form a part of the estate; and, indeed, in every direction, noble oaks
many centuries old, limes of marvellous beauty, and chestnuts of enormous
growth are abundant, and give an air of unsurpassed grandeur to the
domain. There is also, in another part of the grounds, a fine avenue of aged
oaks.</p>

<p>The “Greendale Oak” is, however, of all trees, the most curious,
venerable, and interesting. It lies some half a mile south of the Abbey, and
is computed to be one of the oldest trees in existence in this country.
Throsby, in his “Thoroton,” supposed it to be, when he wrote, “upwards of
1,500 years old,” and Major Rooke, a few years previously, that it was
“thought to be above seven hundred years old;” thus opinions of contemporary
people varied some eight hundred years in their computations.
“In Evelyn’s time it was 33 feet in circumference at the bottom; the breadth
of the boughs was 88 feet, covering a space equal to 676 square yards.” In
1724, the opening, from decay, in the stem of the tree was enlarged
sufficiently to allow of the passage of an ordinary carriage, or three horsemen
abreast. Through this opening one of the noble owners is said, with his
bride, to have been driven in a carriage drawn by six horses, on the occasion
of his marriage. The tree has been repeatedly engraved, one old plate
representing the carriage being driven through the opening, and another
representing a horseman passing through it. In 1727 the Countess of
Oxford, the then owner of Welbeck, had a cabinet made from a portion of
the wood taken out of the opening. It is inlaid with representations of the
carriage and six horses passing through the tree, and other designs, and
bears the following quotation from Ovid:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Sæpe sub hac Dryades festas duxure choreas<br />
Sæpe etiam manibus nexis ex ordine trunci,<br />
Curcuiere modum mensuraque roboris ulnas.<br />
Quinque ter implebat. Nec non et cætera lentum<br />
Silva sub hac omnis, quantum fuit herba sub omni;”</p>

<p class="pn1">and Chaucer’s lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Lo the Oke! that hath so long a norishing<br />
Fro the time that it ginneth first to spring,<br />
And hath so long a life, as we may see,<br />
Yet, at the last, wasted is the tree.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Greendale Oak, the “Methuselah of trees,” still stands, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1356" id="Page_1356">[1356]</a></span>
preserved with religious care. Long may this “brave old oak” remain
one of the landmarks of past ages at lordly Welbeck!</p>

<p>Long, too, may the “Parliament Oak,” where Edward I. summoned
his Parliament to meet him; the “Shamble Oak,” where Robin
Hood and his “merry, merry men, all under the greenwood tree,” hung
their deer, but which has lately been nearly destroyed by fire; the “Major
Oak,” the “Simon Forester Oak,” and their brethren, be spared to us, and
remain as landmarks of history and of tradition!</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Welbeck is rich in historical associations, in
objects of interest, and in places of note. Sherwood Forest, with its hero-lore
of Robin Hood; Clipstone, with its grand old Park; Clumber, with its noble
mansion; Worksop, with its Manor House, its Abbey Church, its grand
old gateway, and its other attractive features; Thoresby, with its palatial
Hall; Bolsover, with its grand old Castle; and Steetley, with its Saxon
Church: these are but a few, a very few, of the places that lie around and
invite a visit; but these we must pass over, and, for a time, bid adieu
to Welbeck and its charms.</p>

“Alton Towers and Dove-Dale.” By Llewellynn Jewitt, F.S.A. (Black and Co.)
The Roman Catholic establishment just referred to is close to the pretty little town of Alton, in
which the visitor will find an excellent and comfortable inn (the “White Hart”). The intention of the
founder, and of the architect, Pugin, in the establishment of the picturesque pile of buildings referred to,
was to found an institution, lecture-hall, schools, &amp;c., for the town of Alton; a large cloistered establishment
for nuns, a chapel, and a hospital for decayed priests. The chapel alone is finished, and in it service
is regularly performed by a resident priest, who lives in one part of the monastic buildings. The schools,
too, are in use, and the building erected as a residence for the master is used as a small nunnery. In the
chapel, which is elegantly fitted up, are buried John, Earl of Shrewsbury, the founder of the hospital, who
died in 1852; his Countess (Maria Theresa), who died in 1856, to each of whom are splendid monumenta</p>

Parts of this account are borrowed from Mr. S. C. Hall’s description of Cobham, printed in 1848 in
the “Baronial Halls.” During the summer of 1867, Mr. Hall revisited the venerable mansion, its gardens
and park, with the members of the Society of Noviomagus.</p>

Under a most iniquitous sentence, Raleigh was executed fifteen years after it was pronounced; and
Cobham (by whose treachery the brave knight was chiefly convicted) had been a houseless wanderer meanwhile,
perishing unpitied and unwept. Of their intimacy there is no doubt; and it is more than probable,
that the old Hall we are describing was often the home of Sir Walter Raleigh when conspicuous as “the
noble and valorous knight.” It is grievous to think that so great a “worthy” should have been sacrificed
to the pitiful cowardice of so “poor a soul” as the last of the Cobhams&mdash;the degenerate scion of a munificent
and valorous race.</p>

In 1718 Sir Richard Temple, Bart., was created Baron and Viscount Cobham (the Temples, it appears,
being in the female line connected with the Brokes), and this title is still held and enjoyed by his

Viscount Cobham of the same place; Earl Nugent (in the peerage of Ireland); Earl Temple; Marquis
of Chandos, Marquis of Buckingham, and Duke of Buckingham.</p>

The architect is C. F. Hayward, F.S.A. It is a handsome building, immediately fronting the
Terminus, of a style which may be described as a free treatment of Gothic architecture, without any of the
special characteristics which refer to one particular date&mdash;in fact, it is a modern design, well adapted to its
purposes and position, and of substantial build, being of granite and limestone&mdash;combined with lightness
and even elegance in certain details of terra-cotta work, from the well-known manufactory of Blashfield
of Stamford.</p>
<p class="pfc4">From the lantern tower of the hotel, rising far above the buildings near, and also from some of the
windows in the upper floor, is to be obtained a magnificent view of the Sound, with the near Breakwater,
and the Eddystone Lighthouse, “far out at sea;” while the grassy slopes of lovely Mount Edgcumbe
and its tree-capped heights are seen to rise in front, overhanging the land-locked harbour, called
Hamoaze.</p>

The grounds are on Mondays freely open to all comers; but on any day visitors will be admitted to
them by application at the Manor Office, Stonehouse, near to the ferry by which passengers are conveyed

miles back, besides the drive of five or six miles round the Park.</p>

The name of Cothele is conjectured to be hence derived: <i>coit</i> being a wood in ancient Cornish, and
<i>hel</i> a river: the wood by the river, or, in a mixture of British and Old English, the hall in the wood,
<i>healle</i> being a hall or manor-house. The name occurs in many very ancient records, <i>temp.</i> Henry III.,
“William Cothele engages to defend by his body, <i>in duel</i>, the right of Roger de Wanton and Katerine,
his wife, to lands in Somerset against William de Deveneys.”</p>

It is now the residence of the Dowager Countess Mount-Edgcumbe, who, we rejoice to know,
cherishes every portion of the venerable mansion, with its decorations and contents. It is made
thoroughly comfortable, yet without in the slightest degree impairing its “natural” character; scarcely,
indeed, displacing a single relic of antiquity, of which every room contains some singular, interesting, and
often beautiful, examples. The people are admitted freely to the woods and grounds; and parties visit
there nearly every day&mdash;a steamboat running daily, in summer, up the Tamar, from Plymouth.</p>

Carew describes the building as “<i>auncient</i>, large, strong, and faire;” he was born in 1555, and wrote
before 1600; and would scarcely have described a building as “auncient,” which had been erected only a
century before his time. He describes also the chapel as “richly furnished by the devotion of times past.”</p>

At Watcombe, a pretty village two miles from Torquay, there has recently been established a
manufactory of works in terra-cotta. They originated in the discovery of clay of remarkable fineness and
delicacy, and beauty of colour. The productions issued by the works are of great excellence in design
and execution: they are deservedly popular.</p>

For several of the engravings that are introduced into the following papers upon Alnwick Castle we

The name of Alnwick has been variously spelt at different periods. Thus, among other ways, it has
been spelt Alnawic, Alnewyke, Alnewyc, Alnewick, Annwik, Annewic, Annewyke, Anwik, Anwick, &amp;c.
Formerly it appears to have been pronounced with the Scotch twang, <i>An-ne-wick</i>, as though spelt in three
syllables. It is now by all natives of the place called Annick. <i>Aln</i> (the name of the river), like the
names of our rivers, hills, and mountains, is Celtic, or ancient British, and was given by one of the
earliest tribes settling in Britain; for in Hiberno-Celtic we have <i>Alain</i>, signifying white, bright, or
clear. Alnwick (<i>wick</i> being a street, village, or dwelling-place), therefore, is the town on the bright
clear river.</p>

The first Sir Hugh Smithson died in 1670: he had a nephew who was a physician in Sussex, and
spent almost all his fortune also in the royal cause. His son again was a physician, and practised in
London, and married a daughter of Sir Edward Walpole, of Lincolnshire. The fact of these two collaterals
being medical men, probably gave rise to the story of Sir Hugh having been brought up to be an
apothecary.</p>

married, first, the Duke of Hamilton, and, secondly, the Marquess of Exeter. Mr. Burrell’s only son
married a peeress in her own right, and was himself created Baron Gwydyr.</p>

Minute and most faithful descriptions of the restorations at Alnwick Castle are given by Mr. George
Tate, F.G.S., of Alnwick, in his copious and excellent “History of the Borough, Castle, and Barony of

The fine five-light east window of St. Paul’s Church is filled with some of the most remarkable stained
glass in England; it was executed by Max Ainmüller at Munich, in 1856, from cartoons designed and

noble founder of the church.</p>

While serving in the Crusade under Richard, Earl of Cornwall, Ralph Fulborne visited the friars
who were then established upon Mount Carmel; and attracted, it is said, by their piety and holy lives,
he brought back with him to his Northumbrian home some of the Carmelite brethren, and built them a
house in his own land, which might serve in some degree to remind them of their Syrian Carmel: for at
Hulne they found a hill, with a river flowing at the foot of it, and around was a forest, just as a forest had
surrounded them when far away in the East.</p>

The park and grounds are always freely open to “the people,” and, on stated occasions, parts of the
castle. This is a boon of magnitude, not only to the inhabitants of the town and district, but to many who
come from far distances to obtain free air and healthful recreation from Nature where her aspect is most
cheering and her influence most invigorating. On the 20th of August, 1868, on arriving at the Alnwick
Station, we met upwards of 2,000 men, women, and children, who had been enjoying a day in the Park. It
was the annual pic-nic of persons employed by the Jarrow Chemical Works (Newcastle-on-Tyne), they
were accompanied, not only by the overseers, but the partners of the firm. A more orderly crowd it would
have been impossible to have met anywhere.</p>

In Domesday it is stated that in the time of King Edward the Confessor the Castle of Arundel
yielded 40<i>s.</i> for a mill, 20<i>s.</i> for three feasts, and 20<i>s.</i> for a pasture. This is of itself sufficient evidence of
the high antiquity&mdash;going back to Saxon times&mdash;of the Castle of Arundel.</p>

It is a curious fact that the ground-rents accruing from streets in the Strand, London&mdash;Arundel and
Norfolk Streets&mdash;are still devoted to the improving and repairing of Arundel Castle. In 1786, considerable
arrears being due, the tenants were called upon to pay them; but refused, unless it were agreed to
devote them, according to ancient tenure, to such improvements and repairs. The then Duke of Norfolk
was compelled to yield a matter in serious dispute; and the result was a thorough restoration of the
venerable castle, which, up to that time, had been almost such a ruin as it was left by Sir William Waller
during the war between the King and the Parliament. It is said that in these restorations, between the
years 1786 and 1816, no less a sum than £600,000 was expended.</p>

In 1863 Penshurst was visited by the Kent and Sussex Archæological Society, when Mr. Parker, of
Oxford (to whom archæology owes a large debt of gratitude), read a paper descriptive of the seat of the
Sidneys. From that paper we shall quote:&mdash;“Mr. Parker said that in the time of William the Conqueror
there was a house of importance in that place, occupied by a family named after it, Penchester (the castle
on the hill), which showed that the house was fortified at that time, doubtless according to the fashion of
the age, with deep trenches and mounds and wooden palisades, as represented in the Bayeux tapestry;
and the house within the fortifications must have been a timber house, because if a Norman keep had
been there built, there would certainly be some remains of it.”</p>

Dr. Waagen writes thus of this marvellous work of the great master:&mdash;“There is in these features
a brutal egotism, an obstinacy, and a harshness of feeling such as I have never yet seen in any human
countenance. In the eyes, too, there is the suspicious watchfulness of a wild beast, so that I became quite
uncomfortable from looking at it for a long time; for the picture, a masterpiece of Holbein, is as true in
the smallest details as if the king himself stood before you.”</p>

It is a pretty legend&mdash;and one to which we direct the attention of artists&mdash;that while Guy was doing
penance as a hermit, his lady was mourning his absence, and praying for his return at the castle. It was
her daily custom to bestow alms upon the suffering, sorrowful, and needy; and dole was, among others,
frequently given to the husband by the unconscious wife. He was dying at length, and then made himself
known to her by the transmission of a ring. So she watched, and prayed, and comforted, beside his
death-bed, surviving him but fourteen days; and they were both buried in the cave where the poor
penitent had lived and died.</p>

These are the charges which, according to Shakspere, Jack Cade urged against the Lord Say:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfn4">“Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm, in erecting a grammar-school: and
whereas, before, our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally, thou hast caused printing
to be used; and, contrary to the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a paper-mill. It will be
proved to thy face, that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun, and a verb; and such
abominable words as no Christian ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed justices of peace, to call
poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer. Moreover, thou hast put them in
prison; and because they could not read thou hast hanged them; when, indeed, only for that cause they
have been most worthy to live.”</p>

The old castle of Henderskelf, an ancient seat of the Greystocks, was built in the reign of Edward III.;
it passed into the hands of the Howards by the marriage of Belted Will with Bessie of the braid apron,
“the word Henderskelf; meaning hundred-hill, or the hill where the hundreds meet.”</p>

We cordially recommend readers, for a description, with engravings, of many of the principal inscribed

The dimensions of some of these trees are as follows:&mdash;The Douglas Fir (<i>Abies Douglasii</i>), 75 ft. in
height, 6½ ft. circumference a yard from the ground, and 49 ft. across from point to point of the branches;
<i>Abies Menziesii</i>, height 65 ft., girth 6 ft. at a yard from the ground; <i>Picea Cephalonica</i>, 50 ft. high, girth 4 ft. at
a yard from the base; <i>Abies Canadensis</i>, 42 ft. in height, girth 3 ft.; <i>Picea pinsapo</i>, 40 ft. high; and the
“Adam and Eve” ash-trees, one of which measures 21 ft. in girth at 5 ft. from the ground. For these
dimensions we are indebted to that admirable publication, the <i>Gardener’s Chronicle</i>, in which an
excellent account of the grounds of Lowther appeared. To that publication we have to express our obligation
for the woodcut of the north front of the castle.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
